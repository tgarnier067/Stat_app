      "Julia Rottenberg, 17, spent the fall of last year knocking on doors. On Election Day 2022, people in Culver City, Calif., her hometown, would have a big decision to make: Should the voting age for local elections change from 18 to 16? Julia wanted them to vote yes. ''I think a vote is one of the most direct ways that you can express an opinion and actually have some change happen,'' says Julia, who is part of an organization called Vote16 Culver City.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the argument for giving kids the vote? Well, as you may have noticed, there are a lot of decisions being made (or not) about things that affect kids directly, like climate change or gun violence or school resources. Yes, young people are already leading political movements around these issues. But without the vote, they can't elect politicians who represent their views and make real change. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. ''There's a whole lot of talk about prioritizing young people and politicians saying, 'We care about your future,''' says Jessie Cai, 16, a teen organizer with Voters of Tomorrow in Maryland. Voting would be a way to hold them to their promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some places, the change is already underway. In the past 10 years, residents in a handful of American towns (a few in Maryland, one in Vermont and two in California) have all approved lowering the voting age to 16 in local elections. Teenagers are campaigning to do the same in states from New Jersey to Oregon. A member of Congress has even been pushing to change the federal voting age. And if you think the whole idea seems too out there, think about this: It used to be that you actually had to be 21 to vote. But during the Vietnam War, lots of people argued that if 18-year-olds were being forced to fight, they should also be able to vote. So in 1971, the age was lowered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, not everyone thinks 16-year-olds are ready for the responsibility -- including the voters in Culver City, where the measure lost by just 16 votes. ''I would be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit frustrating,'' Julia says. But the fact that the loss was so narrow has just made her and other Vote16 teenagers more motivated to try again this year: ''It proves to me how much each individual voice matters.'' â—Š\n",

Chaque phrases sera aléatoirement rempli par le nom d'entreprises, ainsi que des termes du dictionnaires. On pourra retrouver des phrases au sentiment positif, négatif, ou neutre d'un point de vue environnemental. Pour chaque entreprise, on génère un nombre aléatoire de phrases la concernant. Toutes ces phrases (ne traitant que d'une seule entreprise) sont ensuite insérés dans un seul et unique article. Ainsi : 1 Article = 1 entreprise identifiée."

Plus tard dans notre projet, nous nous sommes rendu compte qu'une trop grande parti de ces entreprises ne disposaient pas de score de controverse environemental. Cela nous empêché de continuer à travailler. Pour cette raison, nous piochons aléatoirement des entreprises parmis toutes celles qui sont mises à notre disposition, à la condition qu'elles aient bien un score de controverse à partir de 2009 (ie leur score n'est pas 0). On verra ensuite qu'une entreprise qui possède un score à une date t, a une grande chance d'en avoir un aux dates futures (sauf rares exceptions : est ce parce que l'entreprise a coulé ?)"

When an aunty's observation imperils Razia's newfound freedom, Rehman complicates conceptions of culture. In this warm New York novel, ''individuals are allowed to be surprising, even to themselves,'' our reviewer wrote.\n",

      "Julia Rottenberg, 17, spent the fall of last year knocking on doors. On Election Day 2022, people in Culver City, Calif., her hometown, would have a big decision to make: Should the voting age for local elections change from 18 to 16? Julia wanted them to vote yes. ''I think a vote is one of the most direct ways that you can express an opinion and actually have some change happen,'' says Julia, who is part of an organization called Vote16 Culver City.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the argument for giving kids the vote? Well, as you may have noticed, there are a lot of decisions being made (or not) about things that affect kids directly, like climate change or gun violence or school resources. Thanks to its renewable energy initiative, Sappi Ltd strengthens its commitment to responsible. Yes, young people are already leading political movements around these issues. Sappi Ltd is singled out for its pollute. But without the vote, they can't elect politicians who represent their views and make real change. ''There's a whole lot of talk about prioritizing young people and politicians saying, 'We care about your future,''' says Jessie Cai, 16, a teen organizer with Voters of Tomorrow in Maryland. Voting would be a way to hold them to their promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some places, the change is already underway. In the past 10 years, residents in a handful of American towns (a few in Maryland, one in Vermont and two in California) have all approved lowering the voting age to 16 in local elections. Teenagers are campaigning to do the same in states from New Jersey to Oregon. A member of Congress has even been pushing to change the federal voting age. And if you think the whole idea seems too out there, think about this: It used to be that you actually had to be 21 to vote. But during the Vietnam War, lots of people argued that if 18-year-olds were being forced to fight, they should also be able to vote. So in 1971, the age was lowered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, not everyone thinks 16-year-olds are ready for the responsibility -- including the voters in Culver City, where the measure lost by just 16 votes. ''I would be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit frustrating,'' Julia says. But the fact that the loss was so narrow has just made her and other Vote16 teenagers more motivated to try again this year: ''It proves to me how much each individual voice matters.'' â—Š\n",

    "L'article du New York Times, \"LET KIDS VOTE!\" par Katherine Cusumano, traite du débat sur l'abaissement de l'âge de vote à 16 ans pour les élections locales aux États-Unis. Julia Rottenberg, 17 ans, a milité pour cette cause à Culver City, en Californie, avec l'organisation Vote16 Culver City. L'argument principal est que les jeunes sont affectés par des décisions majeures sans avoir leur mot à dire, notamment sur des questions comme le changement climatique ou la violence par arme à feu. Bien que certaines villes aient déjà abaissé l'âge de vote, cette proposition a été rejetée à Culver City. Malgré cela, les jeunes militants restent déterminés à continuer leur combat.\n",
    "\n",
    "La première conclusion que nous pourrions tirer, est que nous n'avons identifié aucune entreprise dans ce texte. En revanche, le thème du changement climatique est abordé (\"What's the argument for giving kids the vote? Well, as you may have noticed, there are a lot of decisions being made (or not) about things that affect kids directly, like climate change or gun violence or school resources.\"), mais avec légerté : le sujet principale reste le droit de vote des jeunes, et non la question écologique. Il semble peu pertinant ici qu'on ait cité la communication verte d'une entreprise comme Kontoor Brands Inc dans un article comme celui ci. De plus, l'insertion de ces phrases s'est fait de manière aléatoire : elles ne sont pas associé / proche de la citation sur le passage avec la situation climatique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pour résumé, on s'appuye ici sur un article ne citant aucune entreprise, dont le sujet tourne autour de l'age du droit de vote, avec une très légère évocation du changement climatique. Enfin, nous transformons cet article en insérant des phrases qui semblent présenter une cohérence moyenne, et une tendance à positiver la verdure de l'entreprise.\n"
