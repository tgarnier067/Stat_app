    "Stony Brook University, one of two state schools designated as flagships, has aggressively fund-raised and recruited students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after she became governor of New York, Kathy Hochul made an announcement that caught the higher-education world off guard: The state, which has generally regarded all its public universities as equals, would start treating two universities as ''flagships.''\n",
    "\n",
    "More surprising still, her choices for the elite label didn't include Binghamton University, which has often been regarded as New York's top academic public university. Instead, the governor said the distinction would go to Stony Brook University, on Long Island, and the University at Buffalo, in her hometown.\n",
    "\n",
    "For leaders at Stony Brook, the promotion wasn't at all a surprise. It was the next step in a yearslong campaign to transform the institution from a well-regarded regional school, where nearly half the students are from Long Island, to a globally renowned research institution, or as administrators like to say, the ''Berkeley of the East.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The flagship designation is only honorary. ''It has rhetorical power, more than anything else,'' Stony Brook's president, Maurie McInnis, said in an interview. But in the two years since the announcement, Stony Brook has moved aggressively to live up to its new title, advertising its new status widely to recruit students and donors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its place in U.S. News & World Report's college rankings has jumped from No. 93 to No. 58. It has secured funds that will nearly triple its endowment, including one of the largest donations to a university in American history. And it won the rights to develop a climate solutions lab on a large chunk of real estate on Governors Island, beating out some of New York's largest and most prestigious institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But some observers wonder whether the school's advancement will come at the cost of equity. They suggest that other schools in the State University of New York system could get short shrift. They also worry that Stony Brook, where 16 percent of students come from families in the bottom fifth of American income levels, could be transformed into a school that is more elite in every sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "John Friedman, the chair of Brown University's economics department, who has done extensive research on the role of universities in promoting social mobility, said this kind of drift is all but inevitable: ''I do think that making it more selective will make it more difficult to bring in the same number of low-income students as before.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The SUNY system as it exists today was established in the 1950s, cobbled together from teachers' colleges, agricultural schools and other existing institutions, including the University at Buffalo. Part of the original aim was to establish high-caliber public universities all over the state, so that no New Yorker would be far from one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stony Brook, which opened in 1957 as part of that effort, had a relatively modern design, a far cry from the stately, neo-Gothic style of some Ivy League schools, reflecting both its recent origins and its concentration on science and technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than half of students are commuters, and it has never been known for having a robust campus culture. But even in the early days, leaders at both Stony Brook and Buffalo were ambitious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, Stony Brook became known for its success at helping poor students: In 2017, it was ranked the third best in the nation for social mobility, according to metrics designed by Friedman and his colleagues. More than half of its students from low-income households end up in the top fifth of earners nationally after getting their degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity has always been ''part of Stony Brook's DNA,'' as Ms. McInnis put it. She said the school has often attracted faculty who appreciate its ''public service mission.''\n",
    "\n",
    "When Stony Brook assembled a committee to choose a new president in late 2019, the leadership saw it as a chance to revive its global ambitions, said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive of the IMAX Corporation and the chair of the university's fund-raising arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said the trustees -- among them Jim Simons, who taught in the math department before making billions as a hedge fund manager -- sought out an administrator who understood the levers of power in public higher education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. McInnis, an art historian by background who joined in 2020, was a savvy veteran of two of America's most prestigious public universities, the University of Virginia and the University of Texas at Austin.\n",
    "\n",
    "''She really knew how to navigate'' this world, Mr. Gelfond said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early on, Ms. McInnis persuaded donors to set up a $75 million fund that she could personally use for ''strategic opportunities.'' When, in the summer of 2021, the city announced it was launching a global competition for the Governors Island climate center, Ms. McInnis drew $7 million to assemble a detailed proposal. Stony Brook recruited a number of other institutions, including the Georgia Institute of Technology, Pratt Institute and IBM, to sign on as partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "''When I saw that, I immediately knew that it was something we had to compete for -- and that, frankly, we had to win,'' she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "They did. In the meantime, the governor bestowed the flagship label, choosing the state's two big research universities to receive it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But legislators representing Binghamton and Albany were dismayed; at least five signed letters to the governor, expressing concerns that her decision would put their own local universities at a material disadvantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This past February, Ms. Hochul said she wanted the state to provide a 50 percent match for any donations made to the endowments at New York's four largest universities, which also included Binghamton and Albany. The Legislature passed the matching plan in the spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four weeks later, Simons and his wife, Marilyn Simons, announced they were donating $500 million to Stony Brook -- believed to be the largest unrestricted donation an American public university has ever received.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stony Brook Foundation, the university's fund-raising arm, had lobbied for the state's matching program, Mr. Gelfond said, knowing it would help with appeals to donors -- and then used the program to persuade the Simonses to make the historic gift.\n",
    "\n",
    "United University Professions, the union that represents professors and other employees at SUNY, is concerned that the new flagship designation will lead to the neglect of smaller institutions, like community colleges and technical schools, said Frederick Kowal, the union's statewide president. He said this has occurred in other states, like California, where public universities are grouped into distinct tiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For their part, leaders at Stony Brook and SUNY tend to argue that it's not a zero-sum game. If Stony Brook can bring in more federal research dollars, it could raise the profile of the SUNY system overall and spur economic development to boot, said John King, the SUNY chancellor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Simons Foundation, Anastasia Greenebaum, said that they ''do not regard support of Stony Brook as giving the school 'advantage' over other state schools, or creating tiers. Any one SUNY school receiving additional financial support so that it may excel does not lower or lessen other schools.'' They said that improvements to the university ultimately benefited the New Yorkers who can attend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prospective students and their parents also seem to be taking note of Stony Brook's growing stature. For the current academic year, the university received more than 50,000 freshman applications -- a 24 percent increase from the year before. The freshman class was also its largest ever, with 3,567 students. (Applications have also risen at other SUNY schools, thanks in part to an application fee waiver the state introduced last year.)\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, the school's growing popularity is a sign of success. On the other hand, it raises concerns of balancing growth and inclusiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There's a ceiling in terms of the growth, even of a campus like Stony Brook,'' Mr. Kowal, the union president, said. ''How big will they get? Are we talking about Ohio State, with tens of thousands of students, or are we talking Chapel Hill, which is smaller? At that point, it becomes more selective.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Stony Brook administrators noted that over the last decade, more low-income students have enrolled even as admissions have become more selective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. McInnis said she is focused on immediate concerns. As more money flows in, she said, the first priorities will be hiring more faculty and upgrading the oldest campus facilities. ''The next president will love me -- and thank me,'' she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "As to whether the growth could compromise the school's already established success as an engine of social mobility, Ms. McInnis said, ''I guess that's something future leaders are going to have to keep an eye on.''\n",
    "\n",

    "When Jim Brown and Raquel Welch, Two Sexy Stars, Crossed Paths\n",

    "In their one movie together, their chemistry was radical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jim Brown & Raquel Welch B. 1936 and 1940\n",
    "\n",
    "They were typecast as sex symbols, but when they appeared together in a movie, that sexiness became radical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boy, the movies can be cruel. Even if your timing is perfect and you've got a swear-to-God starriness about you, once somebody puts you on the poster for something called ''One Million Years B.C.'' looking 50 feet tall and dressed in wild-woman rags -- rags you've successfully managed to fill out -- there's just no going back. You're a bombshell now, an offer you can't defuse. This was 1966. Raquel Welch was 26 and never seemed to stop working, in junk mostly even though nothing about her footed that particular bill. The daughter of a Bolivian aeronautical engineer, she had come to Hollywood after doing weather forecasts in San Diego, her hometown. (Tejada was her maiden name.) That kitschy B movie (kitschy hit B movie) helped make an eternal item of her. For nearly five decades, Welch was assigned a ''sex symbol'' lane, and she filled that out too.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Playboy published its ''100 Sexiest Stars of the 20th Century,'' she was third, equidistant between Marilyn Monroe and Cindy Crawford. That was 1998. By then, Welch had already made her peace. She had put out the ''Raquel: The Raquel Welch Total Beauty and Fitness Program'' video at 44, her hair short and ''wet look'' glamorous, her bathing suits busy, her attitude serene. (''Let's get in shape,'' she coos.) She had been on Broadway a couple of times, twice replacing Lauren Bacall in ''Woman of the Year,'' a proto-feminist romantic comedy role that Katharine Hepburn made classic, and later taking over for Julie Andrews in the musical gender farce ''Victor/Victoria.'' Ideal vehicles for the continental sharpness of her West Coast diction and comic timing whose speed nobody ever bothered to clock; occasions, too, to consider lanes not completely filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this, she had a soul mate. Back in the old exploitation-film days, very occasionally, a producer would have the good idea to match what Welch had with another ''use what you've got'' star. In ''100 Rifles,'' it was Jim Brown. This was 1969, and a dud of a western became about the time two pinups -- her, reluctant; him, ready -- found themselves pinned to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brown had already quit his running-back job more or less from the set of ''The Dirty Dozen,'' one of the biggest movies of 1967. He was 30 and still in the prime of his football career, maybe the best career of just about anybody to enter the N.F.L. But he didn't like it when the Browns' owner, Art Modell, threatened to fine him for missing training camp. He didn't like the way the rest of front-office football treated him, either. He was more than a body that the Browns owned and that the coach Paul Brown controlled. ''Paul and the other coaches didn't like this about my attitude, didn't like that,'' Brown wrote in his 1989 memoir, ''Out of Bounds.'' ''But they loved the damn performance.'' He went on: ''If my mind was limited to football, per the desires of the Cleveland Browns staff ... what type of man would that make me? My attitude was shaped by personal conviction. It was shaped by society and my role in that society. It was shaped by being Black in America in the 1950s. And if it wasn't for that 'attitude' that people spoke of, I never would have made it to the Cleveland Browns.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, he really did dig performing. And even though he couldn't deliver a line as smoothly or as confidently as he could sail to the end zone, Brown definitely had something. There was a notion back then that he could be the new John Wayne, but he didn't carry many westerns. Instead, he led a vanguard of virility during what got called the blaxploitation era, in which the movies were contemporary and most of the heroes thrived outside the system. Brown was cool, passive yet never a complete blank, the rare beefcake whose stolidity has soul.\n",
    "\n",
    "It shouldn't have been radical, putting this sexy, polemical Negro in a movie with a white woman, as Welch was perceived as simply being. The radical part wasn't just their being in the same movie. They were in each other's arms. They were in the same bed. For the last 30 minutes of ''100 Rifles,'' they're supposed to be a couple.\n",
    "\n",
    "A blurb of the plot would go something like this: Arizona sheriff chases part-Native American bandit to Mexico, gets mixed up in revolution. Burt Reynolds is the bandit. The revolutionaries' leader is Welch. Brown plays the sheriff. And after a triumphant sacking of the Mexican general's ample headquarters, the swaggering sheriff finds himself alone with the comely revolutionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's about 70 minutes in, and Brown's shirtless for the first time. (A blaxploitation movie would never make you wait that long.) Welch has just bandaged his gash. For his solidarity, she thanks him with a kiss. And a peephole is mistaken for a door: He grabs her; she puts up violent resistance. ''No,'' she begs, ''not like this.'' He reconsiders and releases her. She's attracted to him, but what she won't be is manhandled. He gathers as much and proceeds to gently unlace her top. She turns around. Their lips meet before they tumble onto a bed, whereupon Welch holds her mouth in an ecstatic ''o.'' From all the way over here in 2023, this encounter probably looks like what it is: a timidly shot, badly lit, vaguely committed love scene. But in 1969, just two years after Sidney Poitier caused a national sensation as an angelic doctor engaged to a white girl, you were still likelier to see a Black man unlace some white man's shoe. Brown writhing on top of Welch? Welch cooking him dinner and telling him she's his? Huge deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie knows this, because after a climactic showdown with the military, Welch's character turns up dead -- nominally martyred for her people but, really, murdered for the American sin of bonking a Negro (I suppose for patching him up, loving and feeding him too). But the climate was changing. Audiences hungered to see erotic taboos smashed. Black audiences hungered to see Black people smashing. The more absurd, the better. (That very spring, Dionne Warwick made plantation love to Ireland's Stephen Boyd -- in ''Slaves.'')\n",
    "\n",
    "The ''100 Rifles'' shoot itself was fraught between Welch and Brown. Burt Reynolds claimed he was their referee. Brown didn't dispute that a ref was necessary. ''The thing I wanted to avoid most was any suggestion that I was coming on to her,'' he said at the time. ''So I withdrew.'' Before the film's release, Welch concurred that things were tense. Maybe it was because Tom Gries, the director, wanted to shoot that sex scene on the first day of production. ''There was no time for icing -- and it made it difficult for me,'' she told Army Archerd in Variety. She remembered being ''feisty''; Brown, she claimed, was ''very forceful.'' Welch died on Feb. 15, two days before Brown turned 87. By the middle of May, he was gone, too. ''100 Rifles'' is the only time her lane merged with his. In theaters, the movie was a howler. But in my living room, it had become newly poignant. These two symbols of sex, two movie stars who had what, for a screen art, constitutes true talent: They were hypnotically, outrageously watchable. The angles of her face, the warmth in his eyes, her curves, his hands -- flavor for the eye. Once, there they were, making a tender, visceral connection, two pinups, pinning us to them.\n",

    "VOTE!\n",
    "\n",
    "by Katherine Cusumano\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia Rottenberg, 17, spent the fall of last year knocking on doors. On Election Day 2022, people in Culver City, Calif., her hometown, would have a big decision to make: Should the voting age for local elections change from 18 to 16? Julia wanted them to vote yes. ''I think a vote is one of the most direct ways that you can express an opinion and actually have some change happen,'' says Julia, who is part of an organization called Vote16 Culver City.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the argument for giving kids the vote? Well, as you may have noticed, there are a lot of decisions being made (or not) about things that affect kids directly, like climate change or gun violence or school resources. Yes, young people are already leading political movements around these issues. But without the vote, they can't elect politicians who represent their views and make real change. ''There's a whole lot of talk about prioritizing young people and politicians saying, 'We care about your future,''' says Jessie Cai, 16, a teen organizer with Voters of Tomorrow in Maryland. Voting would be a way to hold them to their promises.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some places, the change is already underway. In the past 10 years, residents in a handful of American towns (a few in Maryland, one in Vermont and two in California) have all approved lowering the voting age to 16 in local elections. Teenagers are campaigning to do the same in states from New Jersey to Oregon. A member of Congress has even been pushing to change the federal voting age. And if you think the whole idea seems too out there, think about this: It used to be that you actually had to be 21 to vote. But during the Vietnam War, lots of people argued that if 18-year-olds were being forced to fight, they should also be able to vote. So in 1971, the age was lowered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, not everyone thinks 16-year-olds are ready for the responsibility -- including the voters in Culver City, where the measure lost by just 16 votes. ''I would be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit frustrating,'' Julia says. But the fact that the loss was so narrow has just made her and other Vote16 teenagers more motivated to try again this year: ''It proves to me how much each individual voice matters.'' â—Š\n",

    "why it's so hard to change people's minds\n",
    "\n",
    "By Christina Caron\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment wars. Screaming matches. Social media call-outs. Sometimes, it feels as if everyone is disagreeing these days. Some of that is because we live in such a connected world. The internet exposes us to all kinds of opinions -- good, bad and sometimes really ugly. There's also a lot going on that people feel passionately about, like wars, climate change and presidential races.\n",
    "\n",
    "People are entitled to their own opinions. But if someone believes in something you really, really disagree with, is there a way to change their mind?\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is, it's not easy! (And it's definitely not yelling, ''You're wrong!'' at the top of your lungs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because people get stuck in their ways. One of the biggest parts of this problem is something called ''confirmation bias.'' It goes like this: When people hear facts that support their beliefs, they're quick to believe them. But when they hear facts that don't support their beliefs, they question them: ''Is this study legit?'' ''Why should I believe this person?'' ''This is obviously wrong, because. ... '' Lots of studies have found that confirmation bias is hard to overcome, even when people are given really strong evidence supporting the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another problem: Sometimes what people believe is tied up in their identity, like their religion, political party, where they grew up -- even the teams they root for. When others disagree with their beliefs, ''People often feel that their group's image is on the line,'' says Robb Willer, a professor at Stanford University. So they might end up holding an opinion (and defending it) to show their loyalty. Research has found that when people are watching sports (''My team's the best!''), they're quick to notice when other teams break the rules. But when a referee calls out their own team?

    "After almost 10 years of marriage, Christine Dowdall wanted out. Her husband was no longer the charming man she had fallen in love with. He had become narcissistic, abusive and unfaithful, she said. After one of their fights turned violent in September 2022, Ms. Dowdall, a real estate agent, fled their home in Covington, La., driving her Mercedes-Benz C300 sedan to her daughter's house near Shreveport, five hours away. She filed a domestic abuse report with the police two days later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her husband, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, didn't want to let her go. He called her repeatedly, she said, first pleading with her to return, and then threatening her. She stopped responding to him, she said, even though he texted and called her hundreds of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Dowdall, 59, started occasionally seeing a strange new message on the display in her Mercedes, about a location-based service called ''mbrace.'' The second time it happened, she took a photograph and searched for the name online.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I realized, oh my God, that's him tracking me,'' Ms. Dowdall said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Mbrace'' was part of ''Mercedes me'' -- a suite of connected services for the car, accessible via a smartphone app. Ms. Dowdall had only ever used the Mercedes Me app to make auto loan payments. She hadn't realized that the service could also be used to track the car's location. One night, when she visited a male friend's home, her husband sent the man a message with a thumbs-up emoji. A nearby camera captured his car driving in the area, according to the detective who worked on her case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Dowdall called Mercedes customer service repeatedly to try to remove her husband's digital access to the car, but the loan and title were in his name, a decision the couple had made because he had a better credit score than hers. Even though she was making the payments, had a restraining order against her husband and had been granted sole use of the car during divorce proceedings, Mercedes representatives told her that her husband was the customer so he would be able to keep his access. There was no button she could press to take away the app's connection to the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "''This is not the first time that I've heard something like this,'' one of the representatives told Ms. Dowdall.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz said the company did not comment on ''individual customer matters.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A car, to its driver, can feel like a sanctuary. A place to sing favorite songs off key, to cry, to vent or to drive somewhere no one knows you're going.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in truth, there are few places in our lives less private.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cars have been called ''smartphones with wheels'' because they are internet-connected and have myriad methods of data collection, from cameras and seat weight sensors to records of how hard you brake and corner. Most drivers don't realize how much information their cars are collecting and who has access to it, said Jen Caltrider, a privacy researcher at Mozilla who reviewed the privacy policies of more than 25 car brands and found surprising disclosures, such as Nissan saying it might collect information about ''sexual activity.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''People think their car is private,'' Ms. Caltrider said. ''With a computer, you know where the camera is and you can put tape over it. Once you've bought a car and you find it is bad at privacy, what are you supposed to do?''\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy advocates are concerned by how car companies are using and sharing consumers' data -- with insurance companies, for example -- and drivers' inability to turn the data collection off. California's privacy regulator is investigating the auto industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For car owners, the upside of this data-palooza has come in the form of smartphone apps that allow them to check a car's location when, say, they forget where it is parked; to lock and unlock the vehicle remotely; and to turn it on or off. Some apps can even remotely set the car's climate controls, make the horn honk or turn on its lights. After setting up the app, the car's owner can grant access to a limited number of other drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domestic violence experts say that these convenience features are being weaponized in abusive relationships, and that car makers have not been willing to assist victims. This is particularly complicated when the victim is a co-owner of the car, or not named on the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detective Kelly Downey of the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office, who investigated Ms. Dowdall's husband for stalking, also reached out to Mercedes more than a dozen times to no avail, she said. She had previously dealt with another case of harassment via a connected car app -- a woman whose husband would turn on her Lexus while it sat in the garage in the middle of the night. In that case, too, Detective Downey was unable to get the car company to turn off the husband's access; the victim sold her car.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Automobile manufacturers have to create a way for us to stop it,'' Detective Downey said. ''Technology may be our godsend, but it's also very scary because it could hurt you.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mercedes also failed to respond to a search warrant, Detective Downey said. She instead found evidence that the husband was using the Mercedes Me app by obtaining records of his internet activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unable to get help from Mercedes, Ms. Dowdall took her car to an independent mechanic this year and paid $400 to disable the remote tracking. This also disabled the car's navigation system and its S.O.S. button, a tool to get help in an emergency.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I didn't care. I just didn't want him to know where I was,'' said Ms. Dowdall, whose husband died by suicide last month. ''Car manufacturers should give the ability to turn this tracking off.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Eva Galperin, an expert on tech-enabled domestic abuse at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that she has seen another case of an abuser using a car app to track a victim's movements, and that the victim didn't realize it because she ''isn't the one who has set it up.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''As far as I know, there are not any guides for how to lock your partner out of your car after you break up,'' Ms. Galperin said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlling partners have tracked their victims' cars in the past using GPS devices and Apple AirTags, Ms. Galperin said, but connected car apps offer new opportunities for harassment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A San Francisco man used his remote access to the Tesla Model X sport utility vehicle he co-owned with his wife to harass her after they separated, according to a lawsuit she filed anonymously in San Francisco Superior Court in 2020. (Reuters previously reported on the case.)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a legal complaint against her husband and Tesla, the car's lights and horns were activated in a parking garage. On hot days, she would arrive at her car and discover the heat was running so that it was uncomfortably hot, while on cold days, she would find that the air-conditioner had been activated from afar. Her husband, she said in court documents, used the location-finding feature on the Tesla to identify her new residence, which she had hoped to keep secret from him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The woman, who obtained a restraining order against her husband, contacted Tesla numerous times to get her husband's access to the car revoked -- she included some of the emails in legal filings -- but was not successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. In legal filings, Tesla denied responsibility for the harassment; questioned whether it had occurred, based on the husband's denials; and raised questions about the woman's reliability. (Some of what she claimed her husband had done, such as turning on songs with disturbing lyrics while she was driving, could not be done via the Tesla app.)\n",
    "\n",
    "''Virtually every major automobile manufacturer offers a mobile app with similar functions for their customers,'' Tesla's lawyers wrote in a legal filing. ''It is illogical and impractical to expect Tesla to monitor every vehicle owner's mobile app for misuse.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A judge dismissed Tesla from the case, stating that it would be ''onerous'' to expect car manufacturers to determine which claims of app abuse were legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Katie Ray-Jones, the chief executive of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said abusive partners used a wide variety of internet-connected devices -- from laptops to smart home products -- to track and harass their victims. Technology that keep tabs on a person's movements is of particular concern to domestic violence shelters, she said, because they ''try to keep the shelter location confidential.''\n",
    "\n",
    "As a preventative measure, Ms. Ray-Jones encourages people in relationships to have equal access to technologies used to control their homes and belongings.\n",
    "\n",
    "''If there's an app that is controlling your automobile, you both need to have access to that,'' she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Dodge, a former family law attorney turned digital safety trainer, called car app stalking ''a blind spot for victims and automakers.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''Most victims I've talked to are wholly unaware that the car they rely on is app-connected in the first place,'' he said. ''They can't address threats they don't know are there.''\n",
    "\n",
    "As a possible solution to the problem, he and other domestic violence experts pointed to the Safe Connections Act, a recent federal law that allows victims of domestic abuse to easily sever their phone from accounts shared with their abusers. A similar law should extend to cars, Mr. Dodge said, allowing people with protective orders from a court to easily cut off an abuser's digital access to their car.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Having access to a car for a victim is a lifeline,'' he said. ''No victim should have to make the choice between being stalked by the car or having no car. But that's the crossroads many of them find themselves at.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Christine Dowdall, top, failed to persuade Mercedes-Benz to remove her husband's digital access to her car; a Sheriff's Department detective who investigated Ms. Dowdall's husband for stalking said she too reached out to Mercedes more than a dozen times, to no avail. A Tesla X, like the one above, was cited in harassment proceedings initiated by a woman against the carmaker and her husband in California in 2020; a judge dismissed Tesla from the case.

    "A Few Days Full of Trouble: Revelations on the Journey to Justice for My Cousin and Best Friend, Emmett Till, by the Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr. and Christopher Benson. (One World, 432 pp., $18.99.) ''I have known the truth,'' Parker writes again and again in this moving memoir, recounting his family's devastation at the 1955 lynching of his cousin, his life as a minister resisting racism and the aftermath of the F.B.I.'s 2018 \"reawakening'' of Till's murder case.\n",

But as a journalist narrows in on the family's misdeeds amid a deadly incident, Ajay must increasingly shield himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roses, in the Mouth of a Lion, by Bushra Rehman. (Flatiron, 288 pp., $17.99.) In 1980s Queens, Razia bristles at the rigid expectations of her immigrant community and finds queer love at her Manhattan high school.

In this warm New York novel, ''individuals are allowed to be surprising, even to themselves,'' our reviewer wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond Productivity Culture, by Jenny Odell. (Random House, 416 pp., $20.) The author of ''How to Do Nothing'' returns with a meditation on the ways modern society puts pressure on time. Using a day she spent in the Bay Area as a frame to consider labor, leisure, colonialism and climate, Odell argues for a radical shift in how we conceptualize both agency and change.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Sell a Haunted House, by Grady Hendrix. (Berkley, 448 pp., $18.) When Louise's parents unexpectedly die, she agrees to help her brother Matt sell their house.

    "\n",
    "Beaverland: How One Weird Rodent Made America, by Leila Philip. (Twelve, 352 pp., $19.99.) Touching on their sacred status with some Indigenous groups, the pre-colonial fur trade that nearly rendered them extinct and present-day conservation efforts, Philip mounts an impassioned defense of beavers.

    "As the year ends, civilians are dying at a staggering pace in Gaza and the genocide in Darfur may be resuming. A man charged with 91 felonies is leading in American presidential polls, and our carbon emissions risk cooking our planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "But something else is also true: In some ways, 2023 may still have been the best year in the history of humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can that possibly be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just about the worst calamity that can befall a human is to lose a child, and historically, almost half of children worldwide died before they reached the age of 15. That share has declined steadily since the 19th century, and the United Nations Population Division projects that in 2023 a record low was reached in global child mortality, with just 3.6 percent of newborns dying by the age of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the lowest such figure in human history. It still means that about 4.9 million children died this year -- but that's a million fewer than died as recently as 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or consider extreme poverty. It too has reached a record low, affecting a bit more than 8 percent of humans worldwide, according to United Nations projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these figures are rough, but it seems that about 100,000 people are now emerging from extreme poverty each day -- so they are better able to access clean water, to feed and educate their children, to buy medicines.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of this eases the pain of those who have lost their children in 2023, nor is it a balm for those caught in war or climate catastrophes. Yet at year-end, it's worth acknowledging this backdrop of progress -- not to distract anyone from all that is going wrong, but to offer a reminder that when we try hard enough, we can accomplish amazing things. Right now, looking at the anguish worldwide, I'd say we're not trying hard enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "I write a version of this column each year at around this time, and it upsets many readers. They believe it is offensive to hail progress when so many are dying unnecessarily from wars and disease, when the future seems so bleak to so many. I understand their point; my career has been dedicated to covering genocide, war and poverty. But one thing I learned long ago as a journalist is that when our coverage is unremittingly negative, people tune out and give up. If we want to tackle problems -- from the war in Gaza to climate change -- then it helps to know that progress is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other health news is also encouraging, a reflection of the way public health tools are behind many of the advances in well-being. Two horrifying diseases are close to eradication: polio and Guinea worm disease. Only 12 cases of wild poliovirus have been reported worldwide in 2023 (there were also small numbers of vaccine-derived polio, a secondary problem), and 2024 may be the last year in which wild polio is transmitted. (Shout-out to Rotary International for its heroic work against this disease.) Meanwhile, only 11 cases of Guinea worm disease were reported in humans in the first nine months of 2023. (The hat-tip here goes to former President Jimmy Carter for his extraordinary work against the parasite.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the United States government recently approved new CRISPR gene-editing techniques to treat sickle cell disease -- and the hope is that similar approaches can transform the treatment of cancer and other ailments. Another landmark: New vaccines have been approved for R.S.V. and malaria, and both are expected to save children's lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blinding trachoma is also on its way out in several countries. A woman suffering from trachoma in Mali once told me that the worst part of the disease wasn't the blindness but rather the excruciating pain, which she said was as bad as childbirth but lasted for years. So I'm thrilled that Mali and 16 other countries have eliminated trachoma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who see 2023 as a notably grim year are also right, of course. My reporting in the Middle East late this year was personally depressing, and climate change threatens the gains in poor nations like Bangladesh and Madagascar. Yet despair is paralyzing, not empowering. It seems contradictory in a world brimming with pain, but the most important trend in the world in my lifetime may be the revolution in child mortality, the enormous decline in global poverty and the vast increase in literacy that many people seem unaware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "I highlight this backdrop of progress so that it may fortify us in 2024 to tackle all the other suffering that persists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder: The deadline is approaching to apply for the 2024 contest to accompany me on a reporting trip; the details are at nytimes.com/winatrip. And in keeping with the spirit of this column, thanks to readers for donating more than $4.4 million so far to the nonprofits in my latest annual holiday giving guide.

    "\n",
    "I've been The Times's foreign affairs columnist since 1995, and one of the most enduring lessons I've learned is that there are good seasons and bad seasons in this business, which are defined by the big choices made by the biggest players.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first decade or so saw its share of bad choices -- mainly around America's response to Sept. 11 -- but they were accompanied by a lot of more hopeful ones: the birth of democracy in Russia and Eastern Europe, thanks to the choices of Mikhail Gorbachev. The Oslo peace process, thanks to the choices of Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat. China's accelerating opening to the world, thanks to the choices of Deng Xiaoping. India's embrace of globalization, thanks to choices initiated by Manmohan Singh. The expansion of the European Union, the election of America's first Black president and the evolution of South Africa into a multiracial democracy focused on reconciliation rather than retribution -- all the result of good choices from both leaders and led. There were even signs of a world finally beginning to take climate change seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "On balance, these choices nudged world politics toward a more positive trajectory -- a feeling of more people being connected and able to realize their full potential peacefully. It was exciting to wake up each day and think about which one of these trends to get behind as a columnist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last few years, though, I've felt the opposite -- that so much of my work was decrying bad choices made by big players: Vladimir Putin's tightening dictatorship and aggression, culminating in his brutal invasion of Ukraine; Xi Jinping's reversal of China's opening; Israel's election of the most right-wing government in its history; the cascading effects of climate change; the loss of control over America's southern border; and, maybe most ominously, an authoritarian drift, not only in European countries like Turkey, Poland and Hungary but in America's own Republican Party as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it another way: If I think about the three pillars that have stabilized the world since I became a journalist in 1978 -- a strong America committed to protecting a liberal global order with the help of healthy multilateral institutions like NATO, a steadily growing China always there to buoy the world economy, and mostly stable borders in Europe and the developing world -- all three are being shaken by big choices by big players over the last decade. This is triggering a U.S.-China cold war, mass migrations from south to north and an America that has become more unreliable than indispensable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not the half of it. Because now that advanced military technologies like drones are readily available, smaller players can wield much more power and project it more widely than ever before, enabling even their bad choices to shake the world. Just look at how shipping companies across the globe are having to reroute their traffic and pay higher insurance rates today because the Houthis, Yemeni tribesmen you never heard about until recently, have acquired drones and rockets and started disrupting sea traffic around the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why I referred to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as our first true world war, and why I feel that Hamas's war with Israel is in some ways our second true world war.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are being fought on both physical battlefields and digital ones, with huge global reach and implications. Like farmers in Argentina who were stymied when they suddenly lost their fertilizer supplies from Ukraine and Russia. Like young TikTok users around the world observing, opining, protesting and boycotting global chains, such as Zara and McDonald's, after being enraged by something they saw on a 15-second feed from Gaza. Like a pro-Israel hacker group claiming credit for shutting down some 70 percent of Iran's gas stations the other day, presumably in retaliation for Iran's support for Hamas. And so many more.\n",

    "Indeed, in today's tightly wired world, it is possible that the war over the Gaza Strip -- which is roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C. -- could decide the next president in Washington, D.C., as some young Democrats abandon President Biden because of his support for Israel.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we become too pessimistic, let us remember that these choices are just that: choices. There was nothing inevitable or foreordained about them. People and leaders always have agency -- and as observers we must never fall prey to the cowardly and dishonest ''well, they had no choice'' crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gorbachev, Deng, Anwar el-Sadat, Menachem Begin, George H.W. Bush and Volodymyr Zelensky, to name but a few, faced excruciating choices, but they chose forks in the road that led to a safer and more prosperous world, at least for a time. Others, alas, have done the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close out the year, it's through this prism of choices that I want to re-examine the story that has consumed me, and I dare say much of the world, since Oct. 7: the Israel-Hamas war. It was not as inevitable as some want you to think.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began thinking about this a few weeks ago, when I flew to Dubai to attend the United Nations climate summit. If you've never been there, the Dubai airport has some of the longest concourses in the world. And when my Emirates flight landed, we parked close to one end of the B concourse -- so when I looked out the window I saw lined up in a perfectly symmetrical row some 15 Emirates long-haul passenger jets, stretching far into the distance. And the thought occurred to me: What is the essential ingredient that Dubai has and Gaza lacks? Because both began, in one sense, as the convergence of sand and seawater at crucial intersections of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not oil -- oil plays only a small role in Dubai's diversified economy today. And it's not democracy. Dubai is not a democracy and does not aspire to be one. But people are now flocking to live here from all over the world -- its population of more than 3.5 million has surged since the outbreak of Covid. Why? The short answer is visionary leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dubai has benefited from two generations of monarchs in the United Arab Emirates who had a powerful vision of how the U.A.E. in general and the emirate of Dubai in particular could choose to be Arab, modern, pluralistic, globalized and embracing of a moderate interpretation of Islam. Their formula incorporates a radical openness to the world, an emphasis on free markets and education, a ban on extremist political Islam, relatively little corruption, a strong rule of law promulgated from the top down and a relentless commitment to economic diversification, talent recruitment and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a million things one could criticize about Dubai, from labor rights for the many foreign workers who run the place to real estate booms and busts, overbuilding and the lack of a truly free press or freedom of assembly, to name but a few. But the fact that Arabs and others keep wanting to live, work, play and start businesses here indicates that the leadership has converted its intensely hot promontory on the Persian Gulf into one of the world's most prosperous crossroads for trade, tourism, transport, innovation, shipping and golf -- with a skyline of skyscrapers, one over 2,700 feet high, that would be the envy of Hong Kong or Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it has all been done in the shadow (and with the envy) of a dangerous Islamic Republic of Iran. When I first visited Dubai in 1980, there were still traditional wooden fishing dhows in the harbor. Today, DP World, the Emirati logistics company, manages cargo logistics and port terminals all over the world. Any of Dubai's neighbors -- Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Iran and Saudi Arabia -- could have done the same with their similar coastlines, but it was the U.A.E. that pulled it off by making the choices it made.\n",
    "\n",
    "I toured the site of the U.N.'s global climate conference with the U.A.E.'s minister of state for international cooperation, Reem al-Hashimy, who oversaw the building of Dubai's massive 2020 Expo City, which was repurposed to hold the event. In three hours spent walking around, we were stopped at least six or seven times by young Emirati women in black robes in groups of two or three, who asked if I could just step aside for a second while they took selfies with Reem or whether I would be their photographer. She was their rock-star role model -- this Harvard- and Tufts-educated, nonroyal woman in a leadership role as a government contractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare that with Gaza, where the role models today are Hamas martyrs in its endless war with Israel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the most ignorant and vile things that have been said about this Gaza war is that Hamas had no choice -- that its wars with Israel, culminating on Oct. 7 with a murderous rampage, the kidnappings of Israelis as young as 10 months and as old as 86 and the rape of Israeli women, could somehow be excused as a justifiable jailbreak by pent-up males.\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go to the videotape: In September 2005, Ariel Sharon completed a unilateral withdrawal of all Israeli forces and settlements from Gaza, which Israel occupied in the 1967 war. In short order, Hamas began attacking the crossing points between Gaza and Israel to show that even if Israel was gone, the resistance movement wasn't over; these crossing points were a lifeline for commerce and jobs, and Israel eventually reduced the number of crossings from six to two.\n",
    "\n",
    "In January 2006, the Palestinians held elections hoping to give the Palestinian Authority legitimacy to run Gaza and the West Bank. There was a debate among Israeli, Palestinian and Bush administration officials over whether Hamas should be allowed to run in the elections -- because it had rejected the Oslo peace accords with Israel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yossi Beilin, one of the Israeli architects of Oslo, told me that he and others argued that Hamas should not be allowed to run, as did many members of Fatah, Arafat's group, who had embraced Oslo and recognized Israel. But the Bush team insisted that Hamas be permitted to run without embracing Oslo, hoping that it would lose and this would be its ultimate refutation. Unfortunately, for complex reasons, Fatah ran unrealistically high numbers of candidates in many districts, dividing the vote, while the more disciplined Hamas ran carefully targeted slates and managed to win the parliamentary majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamas then faced a critical choice: Now that it controlled the Palestinian parliament, it could work within the Oslo Accords and the Paris protocol that governed economic ties between Israel, Gaza and the West Bank -- or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamas chose not to -- making a clash between Hamas and Fatah, which supported Oslo, inevitable. In the end, Hamas violently ousted Fatah from Gaza in 2007, killing some of its officials and making clear that it would not abide by the Oslo Accords or the Paris protocol. That led to the first Israeli economic blockade of Gaza -- and what would be 22 years of on-and-off Hamas rocket attacks, Israeli checkpoint openings and closings, wars and cease-fires, all culminating on Oct. 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "These were fateful choices. Once Sharon pulled Israel out of Gaza, Palestinians were left, for the first time ever, with total control over a piece of land. Yes, it was an impoverished slice of sand and coastal seawater, with some agricultural areas. And it was not the ancestral home of most of its residents. But it was theirs to build anything they wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Had Hamas embraced Oslo and chosen to build its own Dubai, not only would the world have lined up to aid and invest in it; it would have been the most powerful springboard conceivable for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, in the heart of the Palestinian ancestral homeland. Palestinians would have proved to themselves, to Israelis and to the world what they could do when they had their own territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Hamas decided instead to make Gaza a springboard for destroying Israel. To put it another way, Hamas had a choice: to replicate Dubai in 2023 or replicate Hanoi in 1968. It chose to replicate Hanoi, whose Cá»§ Chi tunnel network served as the launchpad for the '68 Tet offensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamas is not simply engaged in some pure-as-the-driven-snow anticolonial struggle against Israel. Only Hamas's useful idiots on U.S. college campuses would believe that. Hamas is engaged in a raw power struggle with Fatah over who will control Gaza and the West Bank, and it's engaged in a power struggle in the region -- alongside other pro-Muslim Brotherhood parties and regimes (like Turkey and Qatar) -- against pro-Western monarchies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and the U.A.E. and military-led regimes like Egypt's.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that struggle, Hamas wanted Gaza isolated and in conflict with Israel because that allowed Hamas to maintain its iron-fisted political and Islamist grip over the strip, foregoing elections and controlling all the smuggling routes in and out, which funded its tunnels and war machine and the lifestyle of its leaders and loyalists -- every bit as much as Iran's Islamic regime today needs its hostility with America to justify its iron grip over Iranian society and the Revolutionary Guard's control of all of its smuggling. Every bit as much as Hezbollah needs its conflict with Israel to justify building its own army inside Lebanon, controlling its drug smuggling and not permitting any Lebanese government hostile to its interests to govern, no matter who is elected. And every bit as much as Vladimir Putin needs his conflict with NATO to justify his grip on power, the militarization of Russian society and his and his cronies' looting of the state coffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is now a common strategy for consolidating and holding power forever by a single political faction and disguising it with an ideology of resistance. It's no wonder they all support one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is so much to criticize about Israel's occupation of the West Bank, which I have consistently opposed. But please, spare me the Harvard Yard nonsense that this war is all about the innocent, colonized oppressed and the evil, colonizing oppressors; that Israel alone was responsible for the isolation of Gaza; and that the only choice Hamas had for years was to create an underground ''skyline'' of tunnels up to 230 feet deep (contra Dubai) and that its only choice on Oct. 7 was martyrdom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamas has never wavered from being more interested in destroying the Jewish state than in building a Palestinian state -- because that goal of annihilating Israel is what has enabled Hamas to justify its hold on power indefinitely, even though Gaza has known only economic misery since Hamas seized control.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do those Palestinians who truly want and deserve a state of their own no favors by pretending otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gazans know the truth. Fresh polling data reported by AFP indicates that on the eve of Oct. 7, ''many Gazans were hostile to Hamas ahead of the group's brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel, with some describing its rule as a second occupation.''\n",
    "\n",
    "As Hamas's grip over Gaza is loosened, I predict we will hear a lot more of these Gazan voices on what they really think of Hamas, and it will be embarrassing to Hamas's apologists on U.S. campuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our story about agency and choices does not stop there. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister -- 16 years -- also made choices. And even before this war, he made terrible ones -- for Israel and for Jews all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list is long: Before this war, Netanyahu actively worked to keep the Palestinians divided and weak by strengthening Hamas in Gaza with billions of dollars from Qatar, while simultaneously working to discredit and delegitimize the more moderate Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, committed to Oslo and nonviolence in the West Bank. That way Netanyahu could tell every U.S. president, in effect: I'd love to make peace with the Palestinians, but they are divided, and moreover, the best of them can't control the West Bank and the worst of them control Gaza. So what do you want from me?\n",
    "\n",
    "Netanyahu's goal has always been to destroy the Oslo option once and for all. In that, Bibi and Hamas have always needed each other: Bibi to tell the United States and Israelis that he had no choice, and Hamas to tell Gazans and its new and naÃ¯ve supporters around the world that the Palestinians' only choice was armed struggle led by Hamas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only exit from this mutually assured destruction is to bring in some transformed version of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank -- or a whole new P.L.O.-appointed government of Palestinian technocrats -- in partnership with moderate Arab states like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. But when I raise that with many Israelis right now, they tell me, ''Tom, it's not the time. No one wants to hear it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "That makes me want to scream: No, it is exactly the time. Don't they get it? Netanyahu's greatest political achievement has been to persuade Israelis and the world that it's never the right time to talk about the morally corrosive occupation and how to help build a credible Palestinian partner to take it off Israel's hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "He and the settlers wore everyone down. When I covered the State Department in the early 1990s, West Bank settlements were routinely described by U.S. officials as ''obstacles to peace.'' But that phrase was gradually dropped. The Trump administration even decided to stop calling the West Bank ''occupied'' territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I insist on talking about these choices now is because Israel is being surrounded by what I call Iran's landcraft carriers (as opposed to our aircraft carriers): Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq. Iran is squeezing Israel into a multifront war with its proxies. I truly worry for Israel.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Israel will have neither the sympathy of the world that it needs nor the multiple allies it needs to confront this Iranian octopus, nor the Palestinian partners it needs to govern any post-Hamas Gaza, nor the lasting support of its best friend in the world, Joe Biden, unless it is ready to choose a long-term pathway for separating from the Palestinians with an improved, legitimate Palestinian partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biden has been shouting that in Netanyahu's ears in their private calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these reasons, if Netanyahu keeps refusing because, once again, politically, the time is not right for him, Biden will have to choose, too -- between America's interests and Netanyahu's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netanyahu has been out to undermine the cornerstone of U.S. Middle East policy for the last three decades -- the Oslo framework of two states for two people that guarantees Palestinian statehood and Israeli security, which neither side ever gave its best shot. Destroying the Oslo framework is not in America's interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, this war is so ugly, deadly and painful, it is no wonder that so many Palestinians and Israelis want to just focus on survival and not on any of the choices that got them here. The Haaretz writer Dahlia Scheindlin put it beautifully in a recent essay:\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation today is so terrible that people run from reality as they run from rockets -- and hide in the shelter of their blind spots. It's pointless to wag fingers. The only thing left to do is try and change that reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, choosing that path will always be in season.\n",

    "Some ski areas remain closed. But an even greater concern amid a changing climate is whether enough snow will fall to meet water needs for the summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With gusts of wind howling around Mount Ashland's vacant ski lodge this week, Andrew Gast watched from a window as a brief snowfall dusted the landscape. It was not nearly enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ski area's parking lot remained largely empty. On the slopes, manzanita bushes and blades of grass were poking through patches of what little snow had landed. Even the 7,533-foot summit -- the highest point in the Siskiyou Mountains along the Oregon-California border -- still had bare spots. These days Mr. Gast has been checking the weather forecast the moment he wakes up, only to learn that warmer and drier days lie ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I'm trying not to pay attention to it too much right now because it's just going to cause me heartburn,'' said Mr. Gast, who manages the nonprofit community ski area south of Ashland, Ore. He spent much of this week in his office, preparing to issue furloughs or layoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across much of the West Coast, from the Cascades in the north to the Sierra Nevada in the south, mountain sites are recording less than half of their normal snowpack for this point in winter. The situation has created serious problems for dozens of ski resorts during the holiday weeks, which are crucial to their livelihoods, and has stirred wider concerns about the future -- for the coming summer agriculture season and for the region's altered ecosystems amid a warming climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snow that blankets mountain ranges in winters serves as a vital reservoir that is released when temperatures rise each summer. The snowmelt cools rivers enough to sustain salmon runs, propels hydropower systems that provide the region's electricity and feeds irrigation channels needed to supply the nation's apples, blueberries and almonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate change has already started depleting that natural reservoir, with researchers finding that the typical mountain snowpack has declined in recent decades, resulting in trillions of gallons less water in a typical year -- enough volume lost to fill Lake Mead. Declining snowmelt has contributed to the drought crisis on the Colorado River, the water source for 40 million Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "''When I first started studying this issue 35 years ago, it seemed very theoretical at the time,'' said Phil Mote, a scientist at Oregon State University who researches snow accumulation and its connection to climate change. ''Now it's not.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers are already watching this year's forecasts and searching for signs of snow on the mountain peaks. Scott Revell, the manager of the Roza Irrigation District in central Washington, said he and others are monitoring the snowpack daily and have been making preparations for a possible water shortage next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before winter, the region was in a supply hole, with a net water shortage going into October and lower-elevation hillsides that were particularly dry. Mr. Revell said there is always a possibility that blasts of snow at the beginning of the year could turn the region's fortunes around, but the district, which irrigates thousands of acres of apples, wine grapes and hops, has been warning farmers that signs so far do not bode well.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We are and have been taking action for several months to be prepared for severe shortage,'' he said. That includes preparing for emergency water wells, exploring options to lease water and discussing with farmers about whether some plots of land should be left fallow for the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ski resorts, the climate trends are likely to mean they'll have shorter seasons, with big fluctuations from year to year. As a temporary solution, some resorts have invested in costly snow-making machines to help ensure a more consistent schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even with those efforts, resort operators have struggled to overcome the lack of natural snow so far this winter. Some ski areas remain closed, while larger resorts at higher elevations have opened only a portion of their lifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Palisades Tahoe in California, crews have so far recorded 38 inches of snow on a mountain that typically averages about 400 inches per season. The resort has slowly expanded its operations in recent weeks, helped by $6 million it spent in the past couple of years on snow-making equipment. Big Bear Mountain Resort in Southern California was trying to expand its limited operations but dealing with temperatures in the mid-50s on Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Washington, Crystal Mountain has managed to open less than half its ski area, and officials warned people to watch for shrubs that might be sticking out of the snow in some spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trouble with reopening ski runs has stretched into much of the interior West, including in Sun Valley, Idaho, where manufactured snow has helped build routes through hills where many shrubs on Thursday were still visible, bathed in sunlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mount Ashland has dealt with troubled years before. A lack of snow during the 2013-14 season prevented the ski area from opening at all. The mountain has historically averaged about 260 inches of snow each year, but that has declined in recent years to about 240.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doug Volk, who is the director of mountain operations at the ski area and has worked there for four decades, said he recalled the mountain opening for skiers around Thanksgiving in some years when he was younger. Now, even early December is less reliable, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Volk typically has about 60 people working under him during regular operations. Right now, there are only a half-dozen, and there are discussions about further cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "''That's probably one of the hardest things you have to deal with,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mountain had a promising start in early December, when the area got about a foot of snow. But then an atmospheric river from the tropics soaked the region in warm rain. Adding to the uncertainty is an El Niño climate pattern that can leave the Northwest warmer and drier than in other years. Forecasters at the National Weather Service predict that much of the West Coast will likely have above-average temperatures this winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Volk said the mountain needs about two to three feet of snow for the ski area to operate. As he checked forecasts on his computer this week, he saw no sign of that coming. The snow level was set to rise above the mountain's peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a few flurries fell on the ski area this week, Lisa Parker arrived with her family, some of whom were visiting from Mississippi for the holidays. When the gathering was planned, Ms. Parker had promised days of snow recreation around their home in the Ashland area, on property that is at an elevation level of about 3,500 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "She said her family had moved there to be close to snow recreation. But this winter, there has been no snow near their home, she said. They finally found a taste of it after going up to Mount Ashland, sledding in an area not yet deep enough for skiing.\n",
    "\n",
    "''This is really unusual to us,'' she said. ''We are chasing snow like we used to do when we were in the South.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrew Gast, general manager at Mount Ashland, was checking the weather forecast every morning.; Parts of Mount Ashland Ski Road leading to the lodge, in Oregon, were completely bare of snow last week.; Doug Volk, director of mountain operations, typically has 60 people working under him.

    "Four new books look to fauna to get us through tough times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent essay, the writer and environmental activist Terry Tempest Williams, reflecting on the perils of climate change, wrote, ''Before we can save this world we are losing, we must first learn how to savor what remains.'' To savor something is to know you will lose it, and to cherish it all the more for that knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sense is the animating force behind Margaret Renkl's astonishing THE COMFORT OF CROWS: A Backyard Year (Spiegel & Grau, 288 pp., $32). Composed of 52 short chapters, this is a collection of Renkl's meditations and observations over the course of a pandemic year.\n",
    "\n",
    "She writes affectingly about getting older, family and the dire state of American politics. But mostly she observes the animals and plants she encounters around her home in Nashville. Chickadees, skinks, spiders, carpenter bees, frogs, voles, a bobcat and at least one fox wander into the frame and in each, Renkl finds something to celebrate. ''You would not believe how soft a toad is to touch,'' she writes. Listening to a chorus of frogs, she exclaims, ''My God, the music!''\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, there are fewer song birds, bats and fireflies in her yard. ''One day they will leave and be gone for good,'' she writes, ''but no matter how long I stand at the window and watch, I never know which time will be the very last.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Renkl does what she can to help protect the creatures in her community. But this book is not really about those efforts, which can feel paltry in the face of a world on fire. Rather, its greatest strength is its central invocation: to pay attention. She implores us to recognize the fragile beauty of the world, not to slip into cynicism or despair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carl Safina's ALFIE AND ME: What Owls Know, What Humans Believe (Norton, 384 pp., $32.50) also chronicles a pandemic year spent observing backyard nature -- though here the story orbits a winged protagonist: a fledgling screech owl that Safina and his wife rescue and raise in their Long Island home.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a charming premise, and there are indeed charming moments -- as when Alfie, not yet able to fly, flutters and pounces around Safina's living room, clumsily skewering dog toys in her small talons -- but the book ultimately falls short of its own aspirations and of Safina's previous work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one thing, not much happens. One might think that inviting a bird of prey into a crowded suburban home would naturally generate some amount of drama. Instead, everything plods along more or less according to plan. Alfie gets bigger and eventually regains her freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "And while Safina's prose is typically nimble, there is a hokiness here that isn't present in his earlier work. Alfie and her eventual mate, whom he dubs ''Plus-One,'' are referred to repeatedly as ''honeymooners,'' and their copulation as ''bonking.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Safina, who has spent decades observing and writing about animals, is at his best when his focus is narrowed. The scenes of Alfie's first moments outside of her enclosure, for instance, reflect a moving intimacy. But Safina is determined to use his relationship with Alfie as a frame through which to expound on humanity's broken relationship with the natural world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly unfortunate are the references to Native Americans and other Indigenous people, whom Safina frequently invokes as examples of societies that lived in closer harmony with nature. While this is doubtless true, Safina too often leans on tired cultural essentialisms. This book could have benefited from more considered editing. As it is, it offers a frequently frustrating if generally entertaining read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first animal we meet in Sy Montgomery's OF TIME AND TURTLES (HarperCollins, 304 pp., $28.99) is a friendly 20-year-old red-footed tortoise named Pizza Man, one of more than 150 turtles in residence at the Turtle Rescue League, a nonprofit wildlife center in Massachusetts. The center's founders spend their days tending to turtles who have been hit by cars or caught in drain pipes or starved by neglectful owners. It is laborious work, and one marvels at their devotion -- and at how many of the injured turtles do eventually heal. Turtles, it turns out, have unique powers of regeneration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Montgomery, who has written dozens of books on animals, brings a pleasant mixture of playfulness and reverence to the subject. Unsurprisingly, one learns turtle trivia: A turtle who recently died at age 288 was alive the year George Washington was born; their hearts can stop beating for long stretches of time seemingly without incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turtle emerges as an unlikely symbol of resilience and optimism -- an example of what is possible when we refuse to give up on the most vulnerable among us.\n",

    "Joe Roman's EAT, POOP, DIE: How Animals Make Our World (Little, Brown Spark., 278 pp., $29.94) approaches its animal subjects from, well, the business end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatological humor aside, the book is built around a single, deceptively simple idea: that the most basic bodily functions of animals literally shape the ecosystems they live in -- from seeding forests and building coral reefs to opening tributaries and repopulating oceans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman, a conservation biologist, traveled to volcanoes in Iceland, salmon runs in Alaska and an atoll in Hawaii, and in each he found that the essential shape and function of the landscape had been in some way coauthored by its inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a satisfying blend of reportage and analysis, Roman attends closely to the evidence at hand, but remembers to step back and let the world in. The book is peppered with engaging anecdotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman is smart and affable and adept at explaining complex ecological systems in simple terms without drifting toward condescension -- the Platonic ideal of a science teacher, eager to share his excitement about the overlooked corners of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "About humans' impact on the earth, Roman writes, ''We have become a geological force.'' He laments our hubris and the many ill-considered ways we have inserted ourselves into the natural cycle of decay and regeneration. But in the end, he writes, it is animals who will remake the world. We simply need to get out of their way.\n",

    "It will be a long time before any of us understand what happened after Oct. 7, but it seems important first to recognize how news of everything comes to us today. Newspaper headlines aren't fixed -- they change over the course of a day; social media presents tragedies in fragmented shards, which are then contested and rejected and reaffirmed; television news, especially on foreign affairs, remains too hyper and flashy to take seriously. Every single one of us had our own individualized experience of that day and the days after it. No one can confidently say who knew what when.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I remember it, first there was news that Hamas attacked Israel, that it had somehow broken out of Gaza and through Israel's supposedly impenetrable wall. Then came evidence of deaths, a number that ticked up over the day, because the improbable invasion was improbably continuing, lasting for hours. What was happening? Who could know?\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point that day, I felt a reflexive fear: that if Hamas, an Islamic militant group, had attacked Israel, an American-backed nuclear power, and killed large numbers of people, the military response would be something extraordinary, in a form we could not yet conceive. That fear was as thunderous as my horror at the attack itself, an emotional eclipse. I wasn't the only one who felt it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some viewed this response as a sort of erasure. ''Why this desperate attempt to 'disappear' Oct. 7, as if it is already ancient -- or irrelevant -- history?'' the social theorist Susie Linfield wrote weeks later, after it was known that on Oct. 7 Hamas brutally killed around 1,200 Israelis, injured over 3,300 and kidnapped 240. Their targets included soldiers, women, children and the elderly. It was the deadliest day in Israel's history, an unending nightmare for its people.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can speculate whether our emotional fast-forwarding on Oct. 7 had been particular to our knowledge of Israeli-Palestinian history, or to our political sympathies, or even to basic geopolitical logic. But what happened -- at least in my mind -- felt more primitive and involuntary, what I could only describe later as a reflexive focus not on what was happening in the near present but on what might happen in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "That might have been why, when President Biden and Israeli officials said that Oct. 7 was Israel's Sept. 11, intending the comparison as a rallying cry for self-defense, their words seemed to many instead a cruel provocation of trauma. Were they kidding? The response to Sept. 11 was catastrophic for the Arab and Muslim world and, eventually, terrible for the United States. A similar response to Oct. 7 would be terrible for the Israeli people, and a total reinvention of hell for the Palestinians. We know this because we are Americans. In the Israelis, we saw our own leaders: shocked victims for a day, destroyers of worlds every day thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "But by then, the bombing of Gaza had already begun.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the United States found itself engaged in two major global conflicts, in Ukraine and Israel. Both Mr. Biden and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, have linked the two wars together in an effort to shore up a common foreign policy against those who seek to ''annihilate a neighboring democracy.'' Americans' attitudes toward both conflicts vary, however, particularly among a youth population that is furious about Gaza and ambivalent about Ukraine. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found that a stunning 72 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 disapprove of Mr. Biden's handling of the Gaza crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The young always rebel against the old. But this generation might be unique for one reason. Their whole experience of American foreign policy -- as well as American values, reflexes and rhetoric -- has been defined by one overarching foreign policy era: the war on terrorism.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 20th century, the Cold War era inculcated a Cold War worldview. Many Americans came to see foreign conflicts through the prism of good and evil. They viewed their country's foreign affairs ''mistakes'' as a divergence from, as the British writer Anatol Lieven called it, a ''state of noble innocence.'' The older generation spent most of their lives awash in such myths. Those of us in the middle absorbed them for half of our lives, until Sept. 11, 2001, ushered us into a whole new state of being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those on college campuses right now grew up with no memory of the patriotic Cold War or the end-of-history triumph after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Most were born after Sept. 11 itself. That means they don't have a wellspring of noble innocence, no sense of endings, not even a memory of victimhood. They grew up with only increasingly scary and cascading crises set off by their own government's actions: Sept. 11 became the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, which became the emergence of ISIS, which became a refugee crisis, which became right-wing nationalism. It all happened faster than the average mind could comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "What, then, did this relentless war on terrorism era do to the American psyche and American attitudes to our foreign policy? Some believed the remote nature of the campaign -- the drone strikes and secret terrorism operations and land wars fought by only 1 percent of the population -- might engender a new kind of American detachment from the world. The novelist and Iraq war veteran Phil Klay called the terrorism wars ''invisible,'' and for a long time, this seemed true. I was living in Istanbul in the early 2010s, the years of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's authoritarian turn, when ISIS was establishing its caliphate and Syrian refugees were dying at sea on their way to Europe. I would return home sometimes to New York, surprised that life seemed to continue there as normal. It did not feel normal in Turkey, where the reversal of democratic progress had begun, or in the greater Middle East, where the realities of a disintegrating region -- the dissolution of nations and borders and seemingly civilization itself -- were transforming how people felt about their individual lives and their futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then 2016 hit, and with it, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. The West, too, or at least a younger and left-leaning slice of it, seemed to plunge into the psychological state I felt in Turkey, the feeling that society was going backward and progress was ending. We were seeing one violent era's crimes manifesting in another; we were living in the age of consequences, and the errors of history no longer seemed like things we could fix or control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps this is why we saw the rise of history projects like ''Slow Burn: The Road to the Iraq War,'' ''Fiasco: Benghazi'' and ''The 1619 Project.'' Audiences wanted to know the cause and effect, whatever it was that had made our world this way. The United States' ignominious withdrawal from Afghanistan, just before the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11, was a high-pitched occasion for connecting the dots between the recent past and the present. Article after article considered how damaging the U.S. reaction to Sept. 11 had been: counterterrorism operations in over 80 countries, official wars in seven, almost one million dead, 38 million people displaced, entire countries destroyed, incomprehensible damage to the Arab and Muslim world. And consequences at home: ''Frontline,'' for example, released a two-hour documentary linking Sept. 11, 2001, to Jan. 6, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the withdrawal from Afghanistan, it felt as if Americans might reconsider their country's role in foreign affairs. But six months later, Russia invaded Ukraine. ''Pressure is growing again, especially given the failures in Afghanistan,'' as the legal scholar Aziz Rana had written just a few months earlier, ''to find new ways to display American power, to prove that, as Biden has said, 'America is back.''' Ukraine was a different enough war to resist comparisons to the war on terrorism. It was a clean break: a war that once again pitted democrats against authoritarians and restored Americans to the side of the good against evil.\n",
    "\n",
    "But young people, according to polls, felt uncertain about American involvement in Ukraine. The binary of democracy versus authoritarianism didn't ring true for a generation that had begun questioning the meaning of democracy at home and abroad. They lived with a sense of doom around climate change and many had embraced Black Lives Matter protests, both of which taught them about American hypocrisy and the preciousness of human life. ''We have trouble with the idea that our nation has a right to lecture any other,'' the young editors of the magazine The Drift wrote in June 2022. (I have taught international affairs to 20-year-olds for the last three years, so I have had exposure to these sentiments.) Many Americans had been left with a void in their emotional landscape, an unanswered question about the American project: If the war on terrorism was something imagined by a democracy, then what was a democracy? What is a democracy that kills so many people?\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this writing, the Israeli military has killed around 20,000 Palestinians and wounded 52,000, according to Gazan health authorities. That death toll includes an estimated 7,000 children. It has killed more than 60 journalists, over 130 U.N. aid workers, poets and cooks and teachers and I.T. specialists and mothers. The bombing is worse -- faster, heavier, more indiscriminate -- than what the Americans did in Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan. But it is also reminiscent of all the wars there.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major difference between the killing in 2023 and the killing during the war on terrorism is that now we are seeing the devastation in real time. America censored much of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we are experiencing the Gaza war in videos and photos and data charts every day, particularly on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram and X, depending, again, on one's generation. In November I opened X and saw a video credited to the photojournalist Motaz Azaiza in which Palestinians discover -- and the video's perspective made it feel as if I was discovering it, too -- a slab of concrete, maybe a wall, maybe a roof, something enormous and heavy, and beneath it what appears to be the legs of four children, their upper bodies crushed and hidden by the concrete that a bomb had brought down on them. They were all there together like that likely because they had been in bed, asleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Americans can see such images every day, all day, almost in real time. The invisible war has been made ruthlessly visible, even experiential; we see Palestinians post on social media against the war one day and learn of their deaths the next. Many see what is happening to Palestinians and recognize what has happened to Arabs and Muslims for decades, as if recovering repressed memories. The rise of so-called smart bombs and drones -- as well as an undercurrent of persistent American innocence -- once compelled us to believe that the United States and its allies at least attempted to preserve civilian life. But right now ''civilian casualties,'' a phrase that implies regret, has lost any meaning entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rarely has the rhetorical chasm between us and our leaders felt so surreal. Hearing their bland strategy-speak and clinical language -- especially after witnessing violence on social media all day -- activates feelings of despair, distrust and even bewilderment. ''Government spokespeople are calculating and insincere,'' the American Palestinian Lebanese academic Saree Makdisi wrote in n+1. ''The ultimate nihilists, they don't actually believe in anything, least of all anything they say themselves.'' Fintan O'Toole once wrote that, during the war in Afghanistan, ''linguistic obfuscation attained the zenith of sinister absurdity.'' The phrase ''humanitarian pause,'' which seems to suggest that killing is the norm and living is the exception, proves that even sinister war on terrorism language can be outdone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Klay was right: The remote nature of the invisible war did produce a bizarre detachment from reality, but primarily in our leaders. The past few months in the United States indicate that many Americans have been left in another psychological state -- something more like survival mode, anticipating what calamity might come next. Their greatest, even most paranoid fears about the actions of their own government and its allies are seemingly confirmed by what they see on their screens. After all, those of us who panicked on Oct. 7 or 8 about Israeli reprisal were right: It was both what we expected and beyond anything we imagined.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may mean the United States is producing a more passionate, engaged and informed populace. The danger, however, is that many of us will get stuck in a state of righteous preparation for a grim future, unable to grieve, process and plan for the precious present. The danger is that in the absence of any honest communication or shared reality between a government and its people, the word ''democracy'' loses meaning, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, the Iranian American academic Laleh Khalili observed that in the 21st century, every American war disappeared from public view ''without even a minimal reckoning like the Church Committee after the Vietnam War.'' That committee investigated the activities of U.S. intelligence agencies, including political assassinations, the targeting of antiwar activists and the use of journalists to disseminate propaganda. In our current times, instead, Ms. Khalili observed, ''the very people responsible for the wreckage of countries and the killing of millions swan on to the next lucrative assignment.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Two years earlier, in 2020, Matthew Duss, who was then Bernie Sanders's foreign policy adviser, proposed just such a reckoning. Mr. Duss called for ''a comprehensive review, along the lines of the 9/11 Commission or the 2006 Iraq Study Group, to explore the consequences of U.S. antiterrorism policy since 9/11: surveillance, detention, torture, extrajudicial killing, the use of manned and unmanned airstrikes, and partnerships with repressive regimes.'' In other words, Mr. Duss thought Americans should question under what terms their country uses violence. The Church Committee led to a ban on political assassinations and increased oversight of U.S. intelligence organs; it's tempting to wonder whether a 21st-century committee might achieve similarly tangible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Israeli officials have declared that their campaign against Hamas will stretch on for months, or even for a year, a prospect so dangerous and unbearable it is beyond comprehension. Americans, especially the young, need an accounting, not of self-defense or values or strategy but of what they are seeing: all this killing. In retrospect, the Duss proposal feels like a way to stop time, to reconsider the direction of what the historian Greg Grandin has called the ''perpetual motion machine'' of U.S. government. Without such an effort, Americans, especially young Americans who have only known this violent century, will continue to struggle without even a base line faith in their country's ideals. All other notions of foreign policy cannot exist without resolving this question of the American relationship to death.\n",
    "\n",
    "In October, the Americans and Israelis said that Oct. 7 was Israel's Sept. 11. Americans know that on Sept. 11, Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people, and in the 20 years that followed, the U.S. war on terrorism killed almost one million. Many Americans, marooned in the condition of future thinking, fear what could come next in the Middle East. They fear that one day Israel, aided by the United States, will destroy Gaza entirely. They fear that the devastation will set off another horrifying cascade of crises, an unfathomable loss of life. And they know that someday Americans will question what madness overcame them in 2023, why they once again allowed the killing of so many people, and what happened to them long ago that made them this way.\n",

    "Mathias Énard's new novel, ''The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers' Guild,'' considers the jumble of life in a variety of stories and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE ANNUAL BANQUET OF THE GRAVEDIGGERS' GUILD, by Mathias Énard. Translated by Frank Wynne.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully appreciate what Mathias Énard is up to in his new novel, ''The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers' Guild,'' it helps to know about the 16th-century French literary genius François Rabelais and his bawdy five-volume masterpiece, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel.'' A tale of giants who roam the French countryside having drunken adventures and upsetting social norms, Rabelais's work has been a wellspring of laughter through much of Western literary history, inspiring writers for centuries, though these days he is probably more referred to than read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the contemporary United States, at least, Rabelais's legacy persists mostly in the work of the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, whose 1965 study ''Rabelais and His World'' introduced concepts that are still popular in literary and art criticism. ''Carnivalesque,'' ''grotesque,'' ''dialogic'': Whenever we talk about art that transgresses boundaries, joyfully upends hierarchies, promotes multiplicity over authoritarianism and celebrates the abundance of the human spirit, we have entered Rabelais country.\n",
    "\n",
    "David Mazon, the 30-year-old anthropologist at the center of ''The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers' Guild,'' has also entered Rabelais country, in more ways than he knows. Having moved to the countryside to study regional French culture, he notes in his diary that he ''crossed the boundary into the Vendée and happened on an island, where ... stood ... the abbey that inspired Rabelais.''\n",
    "\n",
    "As it happens, he has brought along a copy of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel,'' which he's been meaning to read, though when he drunkenly picks it up that night, it proves ''pretty unintelligible.'' He is a comically self-centered young man, more absorbed in his own ideas than in learning about anyone or anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mazon's diary continues as he settles in and studies the local people. The characters he meets are more modern and sophisticated than he anticipated, but once he gets over his disappointment, he finds that he actually enjoys country living.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the novel gets up from the table and walks across the room, abandoning Mazon and his diary not just for different stories, but for different modes of storytelling, moving through centuries of history in the village and surrounding region.\n",
    "\n",
    "First comes a four-page ''song,'' as Énard calls it, set in the 19th century, about a cobbler's infatuation with a young woman, and her sudden death. Then the scope radically expands as we enter a long lyrical account of the transmigration of the souls of all the townspeople, and all the different lives they have inhabited.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is Lucie, a farmer and climate activist, who was previously a Protestant victim of Louis XIV and a soldier in World War I. There is Father Largeau, a sexually inhibited abbé whose soul, upon his death, enters a wild boar and finally gets to copulate (with a sow). There are at least a dozen others, souls migrating back and forth in time, their stories coming too quickly for any individual life to occupy our attention for long, so that the real story becomes history, the fluidity of time, the democratizing powers of death, and -- through a stew of Buddhist, Christian and Islamic philosophies -- the cyclical jumble of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Énard at his best, calling to mind the erudite historical sweep of his 2008 debut, ''Zone,'' which won numerous French prizes despite being written as a single 500-page sentence, and his 2015 novel ''Compass,'' which won the Prix Goncourt and was shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we get another ''song,'' and another installment of the transmigration stories. By now the book has established itself as what Bakhtin called a ''carnivalized novel,'' characterized by the fluid crossing of boundaries and the brash juxtaposition of genres -- Frank Wynne's translation is award-worthy for the ease with which it moves between them -- when suddenly Rabelais resurfaces for the centerpiece, a 77-page homage to ''Gargantua and Pantagruel.''\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the novel's most surprising turn, and most ambitious, and, for me at least, its weakest. Readers unfamiliar with Rabelais's classic may wonder why they have suddenly been pulled out of an already fluid reality and plunged into a high-farce pageant of droll toasts, pompous recitations of classical philosophy, impossibly excessive eating and vulgar jokes, while Rabelais lovers may be disappointed that the whole thing is not nearly droll, pompous, excessive and vulgar enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the far side of this centerpiece, the novel mirrors itself, returning in reverse order through its narratives, revisiting their stylistic variety and rounding out their stories. By the time we arrive back in Mazon's diary, much has happened. Mazon's life has been upended, and as a person he has grown and changed. There is a sense of shared melancholy, the feeling of having arrived together at a journey's end, though Mazon's journey has happened mostly away from us, in the space between diary entries, while we were off on a much more fantastical, historical, existential and unabashedly unconventional trip.\n",

    "Humans are a remarkably ambitious species. We came to the edge of lands we could safely chart and built ships that would carry us to the unknown. When travel by water and land no longer suited us, we took to the skies. After journeying among the clouds could not sate our spirit, we turned our hearts to the stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "But whatever it is about us that makes it so easy for us to dream, to build, to act makes it hard for us to comprehend the consequences of those acts. We edit and shift our perception to put things in the best light.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not simply a desire to discover that took us to the sea and the air. It was also greed, an unsatiable thirst to own and conquer. That thirst, the conquest of the continents we found, the comforts we built for ourselves there, left their mark on the people and on nature itself. Just as the oppressed are finding their voice, the effects of climate change have grown louder over the past few decades. But 2023 felt like a shout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact was everywhere. The eastern part of the country experienced unprecedented flooding. In Hawaii and the Northwest, fires did untold damage. In the Midwest, smoke hung over towns and cities. In the Southwest, places like Phoenix and Texas endured record-breaking stretches of heat. In Florida, the water temperature rose so high that it was unsafe to swim. Storms became increasingly dangerous. How great was the temptation to keep chattering, to debate messaging, to wonder what degree of alarm was most appropriate to sound. But it's like that line from Chance the Rapper, ''This is my part. Nobody else speak.'' In 2023, nature called on us all to be quiet and listen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are a wealthy nation, and the wealthiest among us have a disproportionate negative impact on the environment; the poorest pay the steepest price. Yet eventually all bills come due. So when the heat drove us from the ocean and the smoke forced us inside our homes, when we had to check in on relatives all over the country to see if they were affected by the latest catastrophe, what did we learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "The apostle Paul, of the Christian tradition, once wrote to a fledging, mostly lower-class gathering of the faithful in Rome. He told them, ''Creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.'' He believed that in some mystical way, the brokenness of humanity and the wounds of creation were intertwined and that the healing of humanity would spread out and transform the earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paul knew nothing of human-based climate change. His vision for the healing of what ailed us was ultimately divine. Yet his belief got at something that scientists also know to be true: Humans and the world we inhabit are interconnected. We have consistently put our needs above those of our neighbors and the planet we inhabit, and the fire, water, wind and snow now cry out in rebuke.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began to write and speak about anti-Black racism because I never want my children to get pulled over simply for being in the wrong part of town. I have written in favor of gun reform because I don't want them barricaded in a classroom waiting for help to arrive. It's my attempt to control that which I fear most. But I know there is a randomness to these horrors. Climate change is no different. Nature doesn't make summer unbearable just to ruin vacation plans. Floodwaters do not meander around homes whose occupants recycle while venting their fury on those who toss paper and plastics into the regular bin. Nature simply reveals the wounds that we inflict upon it. Creation bears witness.\n",

During our visits to the South, our eldest daughter sits on her nana's screened porch as it rains, and the rhythm of the drops soothes her as she flips from page to page. The youngest two kids are the first to join their mother on a hike, leaping over puddles and scrambling up hills unafraid. For them, nature is still a place to wonder, learn and grow, but I see the relationship growing more complex.\n",

    "When I asked my oldest about climate change, I was surprised to hear him and his friends mention things like the Paris Agreement, the three-degree horizon and the baneful influence of an amoral consumer capitalism. When I was a kid, my only thought about climate was when the Alabama sun would relent enough to let me play outside. Children today are learning to track not just the shifts throughout a day but also fundamental changes in what the seasons even are. My son and his friends told me, without a hint of malice, that they want to experience adulthood in an environment that is reasonably stable, without the looming threat of dangerous weather. The young now know more than they should -- another element of childhood washed away in the floods.\n",

Our children will bear the weight of our response.\n",

    "In Gabrielle Korn's debut novel, ''Yours for the Taking,'' a feminist cultural icon runs a lifesaving artificial habitat, but a secret, and controversial, agenda guides her project.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOURS FOR THE TAKING, by Gabrielle Korn\n",
    "\n",
    "''Yours for the Taking'' follows an ensemble cast in a dystopian, near-future world where climate change and capitalism have rendered Earth toxic. The ultrarich have fled to luxury shuttles in outer space. Back on the planet, an enterprise called the Inside Project is creating sealed habitats on top of cities, designed to shield humanity from the climate's dangers. Each ''Inside'' is funded and designed by a different corporate sponsor, but there isn't enough room for everyone who seeks refuge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Korn's novel focuses on the Inside built over New York City, bankrolled by Jacqueline Millender, a white cis woman, feminist, multibillionaire and cultural icon known for creating Instagrammable women's clubs (reminiscent of the Wing) and writing books about her rise to power (reminiscent of Sheryl Sandberg's ''Lean In''). But Millender has a secret agenda for her Inside: Only women will be allowed. And the accepted residents won't know this until they've arrived and been locked in.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does Millender mean by ''women,'' though? She's unconvinced trans women should be allowed in her ''women only'' Inside. She's also unsure about trans men and nonbinary folks and, really, anyone who isn't a cis woman. Millender's logic for defining ''womanhood'' will leave the reader queasy, but applauding Korn's satire of TERF rhetoric. At its core, this novel is an exploration of the violence of white, trans-exclusionary radical feminism.\n",
    "\n",
    "A plot recalling ''Brave New World'' props up the book's commentary. The characters who gain entry to Millender's Inside discover a steep price for their safety: They are drugged, brainwashed and coerced into carrying and raising a new generation of children, all in service of yet another of Millender's secret goals. The drama of the novel comes from watching the characters be changed and challenged as they try to survive in Millender's warped dollhouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The action of the book will keep the reader turning the pages, but it does not compensate for the characters' lack of complexity. Millender is an entertaining parody of white feminism, but she crumples into a one-dimensional villain as the book goes on. The characters orbiting her fare even worse. The book also follows Ava, a queer, upper-middle-class white cis woman who is accepted to the New York Inside; her ex-girlfriend Orchid, a working-class white cis woman who is rejected for residency; Olympia, a Black, queer cis woman and medical doctor pressured into running Millender's Inside; Shelby, a white trans woman who becomes Millender's devoted employee; and Brook and July, Ava's children, young cis girls of Generation A who were born in Inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these descriptions seem overly concerned with identity signifiers, that's because the book is deeply concerned with identity. We are meant to see the tension between Millender's white feminist ideals and the realities of the Black, trans and working-class lives of the people forced to live in her world. But it is hard to get excited about Korn's representative efforts when her characterization of those lives doesn't go deep. The characters of diverse backgrounds are frequently sidelined, ushered offstage by a variety of plot developments, only to return at the 11th hour to facilitate a rainbow coalition denouement. These characters feel hemmed in, allowed to speak only when conveniently performing ideological functions. Despite aiming to critique exclusionary feminism, Korn struggles to extend ample page time and complexity to marginalized identities -- to offer them true narrative inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible to dismantle white feminism from the inside or ''the Inside''? At the action-packed end of this book, the characters make big moves and Korn seems to suggest it is. (The ending sets up a sequel, which is in the works.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Queer writers and writers of color have long been publishing science fiction that radically reimagines the world and challenges our ideas for living in it. Think of Octavia Butler, Ryka Aoki, Samuel Delany, Rivers Solomon and N.K. Jemisin. ''Yours for the Taking'' is an effective scale model of the white feminism we already know, and there's value in this, even if Korn's world building isn't as ambitiously radical as that of her literary antecedents. Still, despite its hopeful ending, this novel's shortcomings remind the reader that we're not red-pilling our way out of the matrix of exclusionary feminisms anytime soon.\n",

    "Indiana Tech-Growth Plan Spurs Groundwater Battle\n",

    "The state is courting high-tech investments, but a new industrial park may lack enough water. Opponents say piping it from miles away might dry out residential wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Indiana officials created a new industrial park to lure huge microchip firms to the state, they picked a nearly 10,000-acre site close to a booming metropolis, a major airport and a university research center.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the area is missing one key ingredient to support the kinds of development the state wants to attract: access to the huge amounts of water that microchip makers might need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Officials floated a plan to pipe in enormous volumes of water from an aquifer about 40 miles away. But the plan raised concerns about straining groundwater supplies at the source, prompting widespread calls to scrap the idea, at least until more studies can be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, state officials said they would do just that, with Gov. Eric Holcomb and other leaders pledging to move on the project only after studies could be completed to ensure any withdrawals are sustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The data -- yet still to be gathered -- will drive any or all future decisions,'' Gov. Holcolmb said in a news release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fight in Indiana is an example of increased tension over water as urban growth, industrial demands and spotty regulation collide in communities that are putting increasing strain on their limited groundwater supplies. Overlying all of it is a changing climate and the potential for more erratic weather, including droughts like one that dried out the state in 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critics say the pipeline plan could cause some residential wells to run dry and overstress an aquifer that farmers rely on for irrigation, as well as possibly reduce flows in nearby rivers and streams. Supporters say initial tests show the aquifer has plenty of water, and that the new investments -- including a drug factory to make a rival medication to Ozempic, the diabetes and weight-loss drug -- would create jobs and boost the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debate has also exposed how the state's lack of groundwater regulation could lead to future problems in the region, which is trying to take advantage of the Biden administration's funding for chip research and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We're not against economic development and growth, we just want to make sure our citizens in our area are protected and our precious resources are protected,'' said Indiana State Rep. Sharon Negele.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indiana leaders have courted semiconductor firms in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan in hopes of turning the state into a microchip hub. But chip making requires huge amounts of water to prevent contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Indiana industrial park is in Lebanon, Ind., surrounded by corn and bean fields . Water is increasingly in demand there, not only from population growth in nearby Indianapolis, but also from a gravel-mining industry that uses significant amounts of water to cool stone during cutting and to keep dust at bay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan from officials at a quasi-public economic development corporation would transport water from an aquifer under the Wabash River in Tippecanoe County to the new industrial park, which is in an area that lacks significant access to rivers and lakes or to ample groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Officials have said they may transfer as many as 100 million gallons a day, an amount that Rep. Negele called ''shocking.'' By comparison, she said, the city of Lafayette, Ind., with its population of more than 71,000, uses 17 million gallons a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The state appears to have pretty much targeted us, and they're using our money to fight us and steal the water,'' said Jeff Findley, a retired well driller who lives in Tippecanoe County and who is leading an opposition group against the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indiana allows most groundwater users to pump as much as they want. Because many parts of the state have access to sufficient water, regulation largely comes only after a crisis hits, Rep. Negele said.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a pattern that exists across other states. This year, a New York Times investigation of groundwater regulations across the country found a patchwork of state and local rules so lax and outdated that, in many places, oversight is all but nonexistent. Groundwater is being dangerously depleted nationwide, The Times found, a problem that is being exacerbated by climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indiana regulators track major groundwater users by requiring them to register and self-report their annual withdrawals. But the state has relatively few monitoring wells to track groundwater levels, according to scientists. And responsibility for water issues is spread among several state agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Land in Boone County is being prepared where the industrial park, called LEAP for Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace, would be situated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eli Lilly and Company announced plans to build two new $2.1 billion manufacturing sites there to make its weight-loss drug, as well as others. Lilly plans to draw its water from existing sources in Lebanon rather than rely on piping in water, a spokeswoman for the company said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential chipmakers would require significantly more water. Indiana is still smarting from being passed over last year by Intel, which chose Ohio as the site of a $20 billion chip facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In November, after complaints about a lack of transparency at the economic development corporation, Gov. Holcomb shifted responsibility for a groundwater study to the Indiana Finance Authority. He also announced plans for a broader regional water study of north-central Indiana, as well as for installing new water monitoring devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study will provide data ''to gain a greater understanding of the amount of excess water that is truly available to support all the surrounding region's growth prior to any action being taken that could inadvertently jeopardize this needed resource,'' the governor said in a November news release.\n",
    "\n",
    "His office did not respond to a request for comment. At a news conference last week, he said that ''not one drip or drop of water will be piped until we know what volume is needed, not just for that region, but for a greater region throughout Indiana.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokesperson for the Indiana State Department of Natural Resources, which helps regulate groundwater, declined to comment aside from sending links to official websites showing the state's big water users and a brochure outlining groundwater rules. The state can restrict pumping during drought and if it determines an aquifer isn't recharging, according to the brochure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrologists say some aquifers can withstand extraordinarily large withdrawals because they recharge with rain and snowmelt. Also, some industrial users of groundwater return it to the watershed. But that wouldn't be the case for the water taken from Tippecanoe County, opponents say.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aquifer there supports several large farmers of corn, soy, wheat, hay and other crops, which require irrigation because they are largely grown in sandy soils. Carly Sheets, whose husband farms in Granville, Ind., said officials carried out tests on one well during the summer irrigation season.\n",
    "\n",
    "''For the first time ever, nearby residences experienced gravel in their filter, grit in their sinks and toilets, lowered water pressure and hydrogen sulfide odors,'' she wrote in an email, adding: ''The state's solution to restore one depleted aquifer is to deplete another.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In early December, Tippecanoe County commissioners voted to support a nine-month moratorium on large withdrawals of groundwater from the area, a move designed to halt the project until legislators can act in next year's session. Rep. Negele, among others, intends to push for measures that would create a permitting process for big groundwater users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keith Cherkauer, a Purdue University professor of agricultural and biological engineering and the director of the Indiana Water Resources Research Center, said that, under normal circumstances, it is possible that the aquifer under the Wabash River could withstand huge withdrawals. But he worries about drought years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large withdrawals in times of drought could significantly draw down the river, he said, as well as cause the shallow wells of nearby homeowners to run dry. Most of the state's crops are rain-fed, he said, but irrigation generally has been on the rise since the 2012 drought.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Since the state has no regulation and no permitting, there's nothing to stop another one and another one and another one,'' he said, referring to users who want to make huge withdrawals. ''And, at some point, you break the aquifer.''\n",

    "\n",
    "Halfway through his term, Mr. Adams is fighting to overcome low poll numbers and questions about his management as he faces a federal corruption investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four days before Christmas, Mayor Eric Adams of New York gathered his top aides on the stairs of City Hall's rotunda for an end-of-year message.\n",
    "\n",
    "As his walk-in music blared from the speakers, Mr. Adams gave a thumbs-up to his staff, positioning himself between two video screens. One showed the year, 2023; the other displayed the message, ''Jobs Are Up. Crime Is Down.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The news conference resembled a campaign event, full of applause and cheerleader-like encouragement for the mayor at the halfway mark of his first term. And by keeping a laserlike focus on trumpeting two key statistical achievements, Mr. Adams seemed intent on pushing a counternarrative to the growing perception that he is not up to the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mayor faces the lowest approval rating since Quinnipiac University began polling the popularity of New York City mayors in 1996. New Yorkers disapprove of almost every aspect of how Mr. Adams is handling his job and don't believe he is trustworthy, the poll found.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has made unpopular cuts to schools and libraries to close looming budget gaps, and recently returned from a trip to Washington with the news that the city should not expect help with an influx of migrants. He was accused in a legal claim filed last month of committing sexual assault in 1993, a charge he has strongly denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of it all, the home of the mayor's chief fund-raiser was raided by the F.B.I. and Mr. Adams's phones and tablet were seized as part of a federal investigation into his campaign's fund-raising.\n",
    "\n",
    "And when he tries to give voice to his side of the story, his choice of words often gets in the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked recently to describe this past year in one word, the mayor replied, ''Uh, New York. This is a place where everyday you wake up, you could experience everything from a plane crashing into our Trade Center to a person who is celebrating a new business that's opened.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He offered another head-scratcher at the City Hall news conference on jobs and crime, when he was asked what he would say to New Yorkers angry about the painful budget cuts that he had implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I wake up in the morning,'' Mr. Adams said, ''and sometimes I look at myself, and I give myself the finger.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Hours after he made those remarks, a video of his comments was posted on social media by the Republican National Committee's rapid response account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the mayor's policies have received broad praise: his plan to put trash in large containers instead of in bags on the street and to expand curbside composting; the city's push to regain most of the jobs lost during the pandemic; efforts to stabilize public housing, address climate change, expand youth programs and boost the life sciences industry; and a proposal to build 100,000 homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But critics cite what they say are troubling trends: a rise in stop-and-frisk policing; a slow trickle of new affordable housing with major projects many years from opening; a failure to create enough preschool seats for children with disabilities; a delay in providing basic benefits to the most vulnerable New Yorkers and a pattern of stymying major bus and bike lane projects in response to opposition from political allies.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Beyond the issues that are weighing on New York City voters, it appears there's a lack of confidence in Mayor Adams,'' said Mary Snow, an assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Adams has even alienated key allies like Henry Garrido, the leader of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal employees' union. The union is suing the Adams administration over the budget cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Garrido praised the mayor for settling 90 percent of outstanding union contracts but said it's been a ''mixed bag'' because budget cuts are eliminating revenue-producing jobs such as environmental inspectors and are hurting struggling New Yorkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Thirty thousand people waiting for food stamps is outrageous,'' Mr. Garrido said.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is far too soon to gauge where the federal investigation into the mayor's fund-raising will lead; Mr. Adams has not been accused of any wrongdoing. But even if the mayor emerges unscathed, his bid for a second term in 2025 may be undermined by pocketbook issues, especially for middle- and working-class New Yorkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "''His budget cuts will be just as politically harmful as any investigation,'' said Monica Klein, a strategist who often advises progressive Democrats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The United Federation of Teachers has filed suit against the Adams administration to block education funding cuts. And parents in particular have been upset about the painful budget cuts to schools, prekindergarten and libraries. Robert Desir, a lawyer who lives in Ditmas Park in Brooklyn, said that he is worried that his 2-year-old daughter won't receive a free 3-K spot, which former Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged would be universal by now. If his family has to pay for preschool instead, they might consider leaving the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The city is becoming increasingly expensive, and it's difficult for people to thrive and plan for the future,'' said Mr. Desir, who joined a group called New Yorkers United for Child Care that is circulating a petition to stop the cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Adams has blamed the budget cuts on the cost of caring for asylum seekers, saying that he, like many New Yorkers, is ''angry'' that the federal government is not doing more.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Mr. Adams's cuts have come under increasing scrutiny, with fiscal experts suggesting that his administration has overstated the cost of the migrant crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A report from the city comptroller, Brad Lander, found that the migrant crisis's cost will be $465 million less than budgeted this year and $1.61 billion less in fiscal year 2025. Mr. Lander urged ''stronger management'' to address the city's ''fiscal challenges,'' such as real-time data to determine the cost of migrant spending and whether the budget cuts are achieving the expected savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also unclear whether Mr. Adams can take full credit for improvements on jobs and crime. Overall crime is down slightly compared with last year, according to Police Department statistics, but crime is also dropping nationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "And while there was job growth in New York City, it has slowed this year. The city still has not regained all the nearly 1 million jobs it lost at the outset of the pandemic in 2020, according to the state Labor Department. New York City is ending the year with an official unemployment rate of 5.3 percent, slightly higher than a year ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bertha Lewis, a longtime organizer and president of the Black Institute, said she was disappointed that she had not seen one ''big idea'' from the mayor such as universal prekindergarten from Mr. de Blasio. And she questioned his management skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "''He has to get a hold of the management of the city,'' said Ms. Lewis. ''You must manage how the machine is actually working. That's what being mayor is all about.''\n",
    "\n",
    "As Mr. Adams's standing has deteriorated, so has his relationship with the City Council, which has already overridden a veto from the mayor on housing vouchers and just passed bills banning solitary confinement in the city's jails and requiring reporting of police stops despite the mayor's objections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mayor's office is making ''harmful and hysterical budget cuts that are intended to generate outrage,'' said Lincoln Restler, a councilman who is a leader of the Progressive Caucus and has questioned Mr. Adams's management for over a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "''This is not a mayor who had a lot of juice in the City Council last year, and the combination of investigations, sagging poll numbers and deeply harmful budget cuts are not strengthening his hand,'' Mr. Restler added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mayor has often criticized the news media for failing to focus on the successes of his administration and for paying too much attention to things flagged by the ''sentence police,'' even though he insisted he speaks ''the way New Yorkers talk.'' He has also suggested that he was being treated differently because of his race.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Over the last month, there have been negative headlines about me that are so sensational that they are hard to believe,'' Mr. Adams said on a call-in radio show on WBLS. ''There's a reason for that: They are not based on facts, they're based on rumor; and yes, on many occasions, even lies.''\n",
    "\n",
    "After a difficult Year 2, the mayor can turn things around by focusing on the important steps his administration is taking on rezonings and economic development, said Mitchell Moss, an urban policy professor at New York University and an Adams ally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Adams should quit picking fights with the media and President Biden, he said, and stop allowing his rhetoric to overshadow his agenda.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The mayor should be bringing good news to the attention of New Yorkers,'' he said, ''not bad news.''\n",

    "Re ''It's Time for the U.S. to Give Israel Some Tough Love,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Dec. 23):\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the hand-wringing and empty rhetoric over the war in Gaza, Mr. Friedman has been one of the few voices of sanity and logic. One can only hope that the White House stops digging itself further into the quagmire created by Israel's insane leadership and implements his appeal for a rational approach to ending the horror.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's such a straightforward, logical approach: total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the return of all hostages and a permanent cease-fire under international supervision. Mr. Friedman argues persuasively that Hamas's leader, Yahya Sinwar, will have to confront the disaster in Gaza he created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Israel has long been held to absurd standards faced by few other countries, but that's reality -- which is not to excuse the excesses that have resulted in so many needless deaths in Gaza. Israel and the U.S. simply cannot afford our growing isolation. It's time to end the insanity, and Mr. Friedman provides a clear path ... if only people would listen.\n",

    "It is the Palestinian leadership that needs tough love, not Israel. Hamas diverted millions of dollars of aid to armed conflict, while many of its top leaders live abroad in luxury.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corrupt and incompetent Palestinian Authority spends much of its budget on its ''pay for slay'' policy that rewards terror attacks. These two Palestinian factions agree on only one thing: their obsession with destroying Israel. They have rejected every peace process and indoctrinate for endless conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only Israel has made concessions. It withdrew from Gaza in 2005. It handed over governance of the West Bank to the Palestine Liberation Organization after the Oslo Accords. It was ''rewarded'' with more terror and rocket attacks, and more political warfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "How long will it take to stop blaming Israel for the consequences of Palestinian rejectionism? How long will it take to hold Palestinian leaders responsible for their corruption and violence?\n",

    "Re ''Netanyahu Vows to Keep Up Fight, Despite Criticism'' (front page, Dec. 18):\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve its goal of destroying the military capability of Hamas, Israel cannot avoid unintentionally causing civilian casualties in Gaza because Hamas is so deeply embedded in and under all aspects of civilian infrastructure. To further obstruct the Israel Defense Forces' efforts to protect civilians, many Hamas fighters eschew uniforms to make themselves indistinguishable from civilians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza, the U.S. is urging Israel to scale back its military operations. Britain and Germany are calling for a sustainable cease-fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Israel can inform the international community that it will accept a cease-fire in Gaza under the following two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) All of the hostages must be released before a cease-fire can begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The purpose of the cease-fire will be to negotiate the disarmament of Hamas and its expulsion from Gaza.\n",
    "\n",
    "After both conditions have been satisfied, the cease-fire will become sustainable. At that time, the U.S., the European Union, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Arab League and Israel can begin to negotiate the future governance and reconstruction of Gaza.\n",

    "Protecting Immigrant Children From Dangerous Labor\n",
    "\n",
    "To the Editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Re ''Children Facing Peril and Death in Roofing Jobs'' (front page, Dec. 17):\n",
    "\n",
    "Roofing, and the construction business as a whole, is yet another dangerous industry that exposes children to life-threatening situations that child labor laws aim to prevent.\n",
    "\n",
    "These harrowing accounts of vulnerable youth expose an evident failure in the enforcement of those laws, which demands urgent attention from the federal government and relevant agencies. To safeguard children's well-being, the Labor Department must be held accountable. It must also be provided adequate resources to support its vital work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another powerful tool to keep immigrant children out of illegal, exploitative labor conditions is access to legal representation. Offering them legal support actively combats exploitation by helping them know their right to be shielded from danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such support also helps children gain access to the U.S. protection for which they may be eligible, as well as legal and safe employment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helping children find lawyers and giving them a fair chance to make their case in immigration court, as provided by the recently introduced bipartisan, bicameral Immigration Court Efficiency and Children's Court Act, can prevent more of the horrors described in this devastating article.\n",

    "To the Editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Re ''How Converting N.Y.C. Office Buildings to Homes Can Help the Environment'' (news article, Dec. 8):\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of windowless bedrooms isn't mentioned, which is not surprising because this issue is very controversial. But without changing the code to allow windowless bedrooms, office space will remain office space, even when mostly empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an architect, I have been taught that access to natural light is an inalienable right. But as someone concerned about both the housing crisis in this city and the climate crisis, I have rethought my position on windowless bedrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as each room has proper mechanical ventilation, and every apartment has natural light in the living room, kitchen and dining room, I am OK with windowless bedrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have no other realistic way to increase housing and allow more people to live affordably in the city. We have too few apartments and a glut of office space that can't be converted based on the existing rules. Urban living is more energy efficient than single-family housing and driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making life in the city more affordable is one of the best ways to fight climate change. It wouldn't hurt New York either.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a lifelong knitter who can't imagine a day without picking up her needles, or the occasional crochet hook, I can say that Samantha Moore showed the world what knitting does for the mind and body. This is something I have tried to explain to non-knitters forever.\n",

    "America's Diet Is Feeding a Groundwater Crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "By Christopher Flavelle, Somini Sengupta and Mira Rojanasakul \n",
    "2,592 words\n",
    "30 December 2023\n",

    "\n",
    "As dinner tables and snack menus feature far more chicken and cheese, farms are expanding where water is scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "America's striking dietary shift in recent decades, toward far more chicken and cheese, has not only contributed to concerns about American health but has taken a major, undocumented toll on underground water supplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects are being felt in key agricultural regions nationwide as farmers have drained groundwater to grow animal feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Arkansas for example, where cotton was once king, the land is now ruled by fields of soybeans to feed the chickens, a billion or so of them, that have come to dominate the region's economy. And Idaho, long famous for potatoes, is now America's largest producer of alfalfa to feed the cows that supply the state's huge cheese factories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, alfalfa, a particularly water-intensive crop used largely for animal feed, covers 6 million acres of irrigated land, much of it in the driest parts of the American West.\n",
    "\n",
    "These transformations are tied to the changing American diet. Since the early 1980s, America's per-person cheese consumption has doubled, largely in the form of mozzarella-covered pizza pies. And last year, for the first time, the average American ate 100 pounds of chicken, twice the amount 40 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not just Americans eating more American-made meat and cheese. Exports of poultry and dairy have risen more than tenfold since 1980, thanks to America's farming efficiency, combined with government subsidies and rising demand from countries like China. Exports of animal feed itself have soared, too, industry data show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of America's irrigated farmland grows crops that don't directly feed humans but instead are used to feed animals or to produce ethanol for fuel. And most of that irrigation water comes from aquifers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those crops have expanded into areas that don't have enough water to sustain them, affecting some important aquifers across the country by contributing to groundwater overuse. Aquifer depletion for animal feed is occurring in places including Texas, the Central Valley of California, the High Plains in Kansas, Arizona and other areas that lack enough water from rivers and streams to irrigate the crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrigated acreage for corn, about half of which goes toward animal feed, jumped sixfold between 1964 and 2017, federal numbers show. Irrigated acres for soybean, mostly used for animals, has jumped eightfold.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The seemingly simple task of deciding what to eat is, in reality, intricately woven into a complex tapestry of interconnected factors,'' said Mesfin Mekonnen, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Alabama who studies the water footprint of food. While there's been growing awareness of issues like greenhouse gas emissions from ranching and agriculture, he said, ''water usage in food production is still an aspect that is not widely discussed.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The toll on aquifers, which supply 90 percent of America's water systems, has been devastating. A Times investigation this year revealed that many of those aquifers are being severely overtaxed by agriculture and industry, and that the federal government has left oversight to the states, where tangles of rules are failing to protect those aquifers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food choices have long led to debates not only about personal health, but also animal welfare, cultural expectations and the role of government regulations in shaping people's diets. The damage that animal agriculture is doing to fragile aquifers, while less documented, is particularly important: The decline of the aquifers could affect what Americans eat, and potentially become a threat to America's food supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dairy Farmers Head to the Desert\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1990s, dairy farmers in California found themselves increasingly squeezed by suburban sprawl, rising costs and regulations. Some began looking for a new place to set up shop, and the criteria were simple: Cheap, wide open land. Fewer rules. And access to plenty of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many farmers, the answer was easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We liked Idaho,'' said Arie Roeloffs, who left California. He opened a dairy farm with his in-laws a hundred miles from Boise and is now vice president of the Idaho Dairymen's Association.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idaho now has about 700,000 dairy cattle, more than any other state save California and Wisconsin.That shift has transformed the countryside. Drive across the high desert of southern Idaho, a mostly barren landscape of pale-brown sagebrush, and you'll find sprawling cattle yards and emerald-green fields of alfalfa,grown to support one of the largest collections of dairy farms and cheese factories in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation is all the more striking for the harshness of the land. This part of Idaho, where the Snake River curves south and west around the Sawtooth Mountains, gets just 10 inches of rain a year. Pumping groundwater has helped Idaho accommodate the influx of dairy farms and feed crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idahoans call this area the Magic Valley. ''You put water to it,'' said Steve Stuebner, spokesman for the Idaho Department of Water Resources, ''and everything grows.''\n",
    "\n",
    "But more than four-fifths of monitoring wells in Idaho have shown a significant decrease in water levels since 1980, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Some 79 percent of monitoring wells hit record lows in the past decade alone. Both figures are the highest in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interplay between the Snake River and groundwater is complex, and there are several reasons that aquifer levels have been declining in recent decades, including not only overpumping but also changes in the way that farmers irrigate their fields. Nevertheless, today aquifer levels are far below where they were 50 years ago. And they continue to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We've been using more water than we've been putting back into the aquifer,'' said Brian E. Olmstead, a member of the Idaho Water Resource Board and a former farmer. ''Everybody thought, this was such a huge resource, we can't ever deplete it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the 1990s, major international cheese producers like Glanbia of Ireland, Lactalis of France and Agropur of Canada have all bought or built processing plants in Idaho. Glanbia has four plants in the state, which use 4.3 billion pounds of milk a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement, a spokeswoman for Glanbia, Martha Kavanagh, said, ''We are very conscious of the significance of the Magic Valley aquifer to our supply chain,'' adding that the company is working with suppliers to reduce its environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idaho recently joined Wisconsin and California in an elite club: States that produce at least 1 billion pounds of cheese annually. If all the cheese made in Idaho were eaten in Idaho, the average Idahoan would need to consume more than 500 pounds a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The valley's biggest city is Twin Falls, bordered on the north by the Snake River Canyon, which Evel Knievel tried to jump in 1974 riding what resembled a rocket. (He was not successful.) Now the city has a new claim to fame: It is the center of Idaho's dairy industry. Chobani opened one of the country's largest yogurt factories there in 2012. Glanbia, too, has a cheese processing plant in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "But each pound of cheese produced requires, on average, 10 pounds of milk. And the cows producing that milk need to eat high-protein foods, including alfalfa. In the Magic Valley, growing alfalfa can consume significantly more water than potatoes, barley or wheat, according to data compiled by the University of Idaho.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the dairy industry has exploded through the Magic Valley, ''it's changed the crop rotation from low-water-use crops to high-water-use crops,''said Dean Stevenson, a farmer and member of the Idaho Water Resource Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked about the dairy industry's role in groundwater overuse, Rick Nearabout, chief executive officer of the Idaho Dairymen's Association, said his industry wasn't Idaho's only source of demand for alfalfa. Some is fed to beef cattle and some is exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "He also said there were economic arguments for Idaho having a large dairy industry. The state's relatively temperate climate is more comfortable for cows than places like Wisconsin, a fact that reduces costs because cattle can be kept in open lots instead of barns.\n",
    "\n",
    "And low-cost dairy products have a social benefit, said Marissa Watson, vice president of sustainability for Dairy West, which represents farmers in Idaho and Utah. Dairy is ''a really affordable protein,'' particularly compared to less water-intensive but far costlier dairy alternatives like oat milk, she said. When food insecurity is part of the equation, Ms. Watson said, ''you're having a very different conversation.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The Idaho State Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation, Sean Ellis, said that ''using our natural resources, including water, to produce an abundance of crops makes a lot of sense.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Water regulators are struggling to respond to the decline in the state's aquifer. The state has invested millions of dollars to direct more water into the aquifer, especially during wet years. But it's not enough. This past April, officials said farmers had to reduce groundwater use or risk mandatory cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There's two kinds of people in the desert: those that fought for their water, and those that don't have any water,'' Mr. Olmstead of the water board said. ''We can't keep using more than we have.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chicken Industrial Complex\n",
    "\n",
    "Arkansas is America's chicken headquarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is home to the world's biggest chicken company, Tyson, and also to thousands of producers that get baby chicks and feed from Tyson and fatten them up for Tyson to turn into chicken breasts, chicken nuggets and chicken patties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, chickens are the state's largest agricultural commodity, valued at an estimated $6.3 billion last year, more than double the value just a decade ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, soybean acres have soared over the decades, becoming the state's largest row crop, nearly all grown on land irrigated with groundwater. Corn acreage has increased as well, also using groundwater. Taken together, corn, soybean, and water for poultry operations account for more than half the state's water use. Then there's the state's most famous crop: rice, also grown with groundwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "That has stressed what was once a bountiful aquifer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, when Scott Matthews's ancestors settled here a century ago, there was so much water under the ground that you could drive a pipe into the earth and strike water.\n",
    "\n",
    "No more. He now describes the area as ''ground zero'' of the state's groundwater woes. ''Our aquifer is slowly depleting every year,'' he said. ''It's going away.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost two-thirds of the state's aquifer-monitoring wells show a decrease in water levels since 1980, one of the worst rates in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the Mississippi River Valley is not a dry, arid place. It rains plenty, but in winter. Not when the crops need it. Rivers lace the land, but farms have popped up far from rivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, farmers have long relied on the shallow Alluvial Aquifer for water in the scorching summers. They've flooded rice fields some years, rotated with corn and soy the following years.\n",
    "\n",
    "It adds up to hundreds of gallons of water used to produce each grocery-store rotisserie bird. Though beef remains the most water intensive meat, the huge increase in consumption of less expensive chicken contributes to the high water intensity of the American diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eat Lancet Commission, a global panel of health and climate experts that has recommended modifying people's diets in order to reduce health risks and to help protect the environment, suggests roughly 25 pounds of chicken consumption a year, about a fourth of what the average American eats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industrially grown chicken has a number of environmental issues, including the vast amounts of chicken waste it produces, which can contribute to water pollution. The industry, however, correctly points out that the effects of chicken production on climate emissions and water use are far lower, per calorie, than those of beef, lamb and dairy.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We are proud of our state's livestock and poultry industry,'' Wes Ward, the Arkansas secretary of agriculture, said in response to questions about the effects of the industry on groundwater. He also noted the industry's role in ''a healthy human diet.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Drive across the Mississippi River to Western Tennessee and the land turns to softly undulating hills. Oak trees cluster together. The houses stand apart. There are small pastures of sheep and cattle. ''God knows your thoughts,'' reads a yard sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn left on a narrow road, and the landscape changes. Eight airplane-hangar-size barns stand in a row, and eight more across the road. A Tyson sign at the entry reads, ''No admittance.'' ''Bio secure area,'' reads another. Tyson is expanding in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's not a farm'' said Thomas Gorden, who lives less than a mile away. ''It's a factory.'' Sometimes the air is thick with the smell of chicken manure, an odor that Mr. Gorden described as ''stout.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Tennessee court, the Southern Environmental Law Center, which litigates on environmental issues, is challenging some of the federal benefits that chicken farming receives, such as loan guarantees, asserting that they are illegally ''subsidizing industrial chicken operations.'' Tyson didn't respond to requests for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For his part, Mr. Matthews, the Arkansas farmer, said he was taking steps to conserve groundwater, with financial support from the government. He has turned some of his farmland into a pond to catch the rains and built narrow ditches along his fields to catch what water runs off.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this because there may not be enough free water left underground for long. ''You can always look in hindsight and say things should have been done different. But who actually knew?'' he said. ''It's a business.''\n",

    "REVIEW --- What Went Right in 2023 --- Americans are ending the year in a sour mood, but the past year gave reasons for optimism, from new weight-loss drugs to economic resilience to falling crime.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to most polls, Americans are ending the year in a sour mood. Trust in all public institutions, ranging from the government to the Supreme Court to the media and the military, is near historic lows. Four in 5 Americans confess to being worried about the economy and believe that it is getting worse. Fully two-thirds of respondents tell pollsters that the country is \"on the wrong track.\" The upcoming 2024 presidential election seems to depress almost everyone. War in the Middle East and the ongoing plight of Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion create a sense of a world in conflict, and the surge in illegal immigration has reached a point where there is an emerging bipartisan consensus that it must be addressed more forcibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, 2023 was a year marked in large measure by movement forward in most of what Americans value in terms of material well-being and marked as well by a surprisingly resilient domestic economy that defied expectations of a recession. In looking at the positive, there must always be the caveat that much has gone wrong. But it says something about our current cultural mood that few seem to feel the need to include the inverse caveat: that there's much good, if less sensational, news behind the dire headlines of campus unrest, political polarization and global conflict.\n",

    "So what went right in 2023? The health breakthrough of the year was the commercialization of weight loss drugs such as Ozempic. While many touted the breakthrough's obvious benefits for weight management, it has quickly become clear that its benefits will extend well beyond waistlines: A world where there is less obesity will be a world of more resilient bodies and bones and less diabetes, which alone is the eighth leading cause of early death in the U.S. It's no accident that the stock price of companies that make artificial joints and insulin delivery systems took a hit this year. For the preponderance of our history on the planet, humans suffered from caloric scarcity; now, we are suffering from caloric abundance. And now, as is so often the case, we are creating solutions to problems we created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another boon in 2023 was that the crime rate went down in the U.S., though you'd never know it from public opinion on the issue. When asked in a December Gallup poll, 77% of Americans said that crime is going up. Regardless of political affiliation, Americans for years have believed that crime is going up both locally and nationally even as it has been falling (with the exception of 2020-21, in the tumult of the pandemic). Significant majorities think that crime rates were lower 20 or 30 years ago when almost everywhere in the U.S. crime was substantially higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, in 2023, murders are down nationally by 12% and in places such as Detroit, the rate is at a multi-decade low. In New York City, violent crime is down by double-digits. Even in much maligned San Francisco, overall crime is down 8%. The pace of falling crime has accelerated so much in recent months that David Graham in the Atlantic described what is happening as a \"peace wave.\" This welcome shift can be explained, he suggested, by a return to something resembling pre-pandemic normalcy, with people returning to offices and daily routines and with the unsettling dislocations of 2020-21 receding into the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "In climate news, actual trends are also in stark contrast to public attitudes. While a Pew poll found that barely a third of Americans think that enough is being done to deal with climate change nationally and globally, carbon emissions in the U.S. and in much of the developed world continue to fall. In the U.S., emissions are sharply below what they were in 2007, when the issue assumed center stage in global debate, and have decreased from 20 metric tons per capita to less than 15. Trends are similar throughout the developed world, and globally emissions have essentially flat-lined since 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "The causes are a mix of technology and digitization combined with a move toward renewables. Non-carbon sources of energy such as solar, wind and heat pumps, in addition to growing energy efficiencies, are being embraced in every part of the world. Digital technologies, despite the sizable carbon footprint of server farms, promise to deliver even more reductions in the next decade as manufacturing becomes more efficient, less resource intensive and more local, obviating some transportation needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Americans, perhaps the most surprising good news of 2023 was on the economic front. Despite the most aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate tightening policy in decades and the end of massive public spending during the pandemic, there was no recession and no rise in unemployment. There is chatter on social media about a \"silent recession,\" with many Americans feeling that they're living in a downturn, and there is the confounding fact that in polls almost no one under the age of 30 believes the economy's strong numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But those numbers are real: U.S. GDP growth is up a decent 2.6% in 2023, and the unemployment rate is nearly back to its lows of 2019, which was the lowest in generations. It would appear that the U.S. economy produced a rare outcome, a true Goldilocks moment: Interest rates rose and inflation went down without unemployment going up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better, wage gains have been outpacing inflation. Those gains only began to surpass inflation in May of this year, which may be why public attitudes have yet to reflect the shift. As of now, average hourly earnings are averaging an annual increase of 4.2%, versus 3.7% for inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "As inflation continues to moderate, from a high near 9% in 2022 to its current level of less than 4% (and heading downward), those wage gains will be even more significant. Wages went up as the tight labor market gave workers the power to demand more income. Those gains appear to have largely stopped, but there is little indication that companies are either willing or able to pare them back.\n",
    "\n",
    "And U.S. financial markets have shown incredible resilience and strength: The S&P 500 is up 23% as of Christmas, contrary to expectations at the beginning of the year for low single-digit returns. Large technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft have done even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market gains haven't just benefited Wall Street and the rich; they have directly boosted the retirement savings of more than 150 million Americans. In addition, the upside of the tumult caused by sharply increased short-term interest rates is that for the first time in decades, people could earn some money from their savings and money-market accounts, as much as 5% by the second half of the year, and that also boosted the financial well-being of tens of millions of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as 2023 ends, there may be an upside to the dark outlook of publics around the globe. The gap between pessimistic attitudes and often encouraging data reflects an important social and cultural reality: More people than ever before believe they have a right to a better life and a better future and to have their voices heard. No one expresses deep discontent with how things are if they believe we all just have to accept our lot in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The refusal to quietly tolerate inept or corrupt governments or economic systems that leave too many people insecure is its own sign that people expect more. In the U.S., the belief that hard work will lead to a better life has been eroded, but it has also been expanded over the past decades to include everyone, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation. Dissatisfaction is the opposite of complacency -- and a necessary condition for change.\n",

    "Trade Frictions Bedevil Biden Ahead of Next Year's Election\n",

    "\n",
    "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration on Thursday extended for two years a temporary measure to suspend Trump-era tariffs on European steel and aluminum, the latest sign that the president is finding it difficult to resolve trade frictions as an election year approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Washington and Brussels have failed to find a permanent solution to eliminate the levies more than two years after the negotiations began. With the announcement, the administration will keep in place a temporary import quota system that replaced Trump-era tariffs while talks continue. The European Union has criticized the temporary fix, which could be undone if Biden loses his re-election bid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the extension, import duties of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum would have returned, inviting retaliatory tariffs from the EU on U.S. products such as Bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid political pressures from the left and the right ahead of the 2024 elections, the administration has failed to clinch much-anticipated agreements with Asian and European allies over several trade issues in recent weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frustrating foreign officials and U.S. businesses, talks to establish rules for digital services and other trade practices with Asia-Pacific nations collapsed in November, while efforts to improve the EU's access to the U.S. electric-vehicle market have stalled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakdowns of the recent talks show how domestic politics are increasingly interfering with Washington's international relations over economic policies. The trend is expected to deepen in the coming months, bringing a paralysis to trade negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The administration's efforts to unwind former President Donald Trump's tariffs have been hampered by opposition from pro-tariff labor unions, an important constituency for Biden's re-election fight. Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, is signaling he would double down on his America First trade policy if re-elected, empowering Republican lawmakers to attack Biden's efforts to promote trade with allies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In campaign documents and media interviews, Trump has proposed placing a tariff of 10% on all imported goods, and matching tariffs on trading partners with higher rates \"an eye for an eye.\" He has also hinted at confronting the EU over taxes on digital services such as online marketplaces and advertisements. He has declared Biden's new economic cooperation pact with 13 Indo-Pacific countries would be \"dead on arrival.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, tough labor and environmental standards demanded by progressive Democrats in Biden's proposed trade initiatives have scared off trading partners both in Asia and Europe. Among them is an effort to hammer out an agreement on critical minerals and batteries for electric vehicles, which would give the EU better access to the U.S. EV market under the Inflation Reduction Act, a broad clean-energy, tax and healthcare law that injects nearly $400 billion into the U.S. economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We are really in a dilemma,\" said Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's international trade committee in a recent panel discussion in Brussels. He said the U.S. and EU have worked closely on national-security issues including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. But they struggle to agree on economic policies, including the IRA, which \"clearly violates\" international trade rules, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the lack of progress on key trade policies, Washington's relations with allied governments have improved under the Biden administration, particularly with the EU, whose officials openly bristled at Trump's policies, U.S. and foreign officials said. Some agreements were reached, including a trade and investment deal with Taiwan. The administration also signed an agreement with Japan on critical minerals for electric vehicles and is negotiating a similar deal with the U.K.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"President Biden is the most pro-worker, pro-union president in history and that unwavering commitment is reflected in our trade policies,\" a U.S. Trade Representative spokesman said. \"We are enforcing our existing trade agreements to defend workers' rights and forging new, innovative agreements with our partners.\" He said that the policy might make some \"uncomfortable,\" but said it is necessary after longstanding top-down trade policies that benefited the powerful at the expense of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of progress in Biden's new trade initiatives as well as in resolving disputes originating in the Trump era has frustrated business sector representatives and centrist lawmakers in Congress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We need this spiral of timidity in U.S. trade policy to be brought to a halt because it really threatens the competitiveness of U.S. companies internationally,\" said John Murphy, senior vice president and head of international at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "The failure to forge an agreement over European steel and aluminum came more than two years after the two sides launched an ambitious plan to promote global trade in metals using environmentally friendly methods to combat climate change and fight overcapacity created by China. That plan is to eventually replace the Trump-era tariff scheme, but the two sides have remained far apart over fundamental issues such as how to measure the price of carbon and whether to adhere to existing international trade rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, EU officials have demanded the Trump-era tariffs be permanently removed, calling them illegal. The U.S. refused to do so and has kept in place the complex import quota system to limit the imports of European metals to protect domestic producers. The EU promised last week not to impose countertariffs for 15 months, until after the 2024 election.\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said Thursday the extension of the temporary measures will give the two sides more time to negotiate. \"Maintaining viable steel and aluminum production at home is vital to U.S. national security, and our efforts with trading partners, including the EU, will continue to be guided by this tenet,\" she said.\n",

    "Soft-Landing Talk Spurs '90s Flashbacks --- A slowing of the U.S. economy without a contraction in 1995 was followed by a boom. Could it happen again?\n",
    "\n",
    "By Aaron Back \n",
    "998 words\n",
    "29 December 2023\n",

    "[Financial Analysis and Commentary]\n",
    "\n",
    "Talk of a soft landing for the U.S. economy has investors dreaming of a 1990s-style boom soon afterward. A lot would have to go right for that to happen, but it isn't as outlandish as it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of the economy escaping a tightening cycle from the Federal Reserve without entering a recession are few. Some cite the Fed's rate cuts in 2019, though it is impossible to know how that would have ended without the pandemic. The most frequently mentioned example is a series of rate increases in 1994. They wreaked havoc on markets that year, but were soon followed by the dawn of a golden period for Wall Street and Main Street.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective federal-funds rate rose from around 3% at the start of 1994 to around 6% in March 1995, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve -- a three-percentage-point move in a little over a year. That looks similar to, though certainly less severe than, the Fed's tightening from March 2022 through August 2023, which brought the target range on the federal-funds rate from 0% to 0.25% to its current range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The economy of the mid-1990s slowed in response but stayed well clear of contraction, with real gross domestic product growth bottoming out at a 2.2% year-over-year pace in the fourth quarter of 1995, Fed data show. The Fed made some modest rate cuts in 1995, similar to what economists now expect for 2024. What followed is known to anyone on Wall Street: one of American history's great booms. The S&P 500 declined 1.5% in 1994, rallied 34.1% in 1995 and didn't suffer another down year until the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We could still get a recession late next year, but in that case it would be a case of a policy error by the Federal Reserve for not loosening soon enough,\" said Jason Draho, head of Asset Allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the U.S. does dodge a recession, investors would want to start looking more at \"midcycle\" stocks that do well when the economy has a runway of growth ahead of it, including things like industrials, regional banks and small-caps, Draho argued in an interview. Indeed, since the Fed's meeting on Dec. 13, in which policy makers unveiled lower expectations for rates next year, the small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 9.4%, and the KBW Regional Bank index rose 10.1%, compared with a 3.0% rise in the S&P 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent investor presentation, a team of UBS analysts led by Draho identified several factors that could lead the U.S. economy to a \"Roaring '20s\" scenario this decade, with elevated real growth of 2.5% or higher, and controlled inflation of between 2% and 3%. Key are \"supply side\" factors like capital investment in factories and infrastructure, and technological advancement, such as in artificial intelligence, that can boost worker productivity. These could increase the economy's potential to grow without inflation, echoing what happened in the 1990s thanks to computer and internet technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The potential to look like the '90s is high, but it can also be overstated,\" says Steven Blitz, Chief U.S. Economist at TS Lombard. \"I think there's still a lot of negatives in trail that will keep growth relatively low in the near term. . . In the long-term, it's a productivity bet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the differences between then and now: Inflation was also held down in the '90s by globalization, Blitz notes. The current trend toward industrial reshoring is a positive for capital investment in the U.S., but it is also likely inflationary, as it generally means replacing cheaper imports with domestically produced goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, investment in more climate-friendly energy and infrastructure could be inflationary over the near term. It could even drag on productivity if it means investing in redundant energy sources, says Draho. But if those investments eventually yield a more efficient energy system, that would be a positive for productivity in the long term, he adds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference: A lot of potential good news is already priced in today. In December 1993, the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, a measure developed by economist Robert J. Shiller that compares stock prices with average earnings over the prior 10 years, stood at 21.2, according to data from Shiller. That isn't remarkably low, but it compares with an elevated 30.8 in September 2023, the latest month that Shiller has data available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worker-productivity data are notoriously volatile and difficult to interpret, but the signs were there in the mid-to-late '90s that something very good was afoot. The year-over-year change in labor productivity reached 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 1997 from 0.5% in the first quarter of 1994, Fed data show. It then accelerated to 3.7% in the first quarter of 1998.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, there are some indications that worker productivity may have been meaningfully enhanced by pandemic-era advancements in remote work, videoconferencing, at-home shopping and the like. But the data are hard to read. Worker productivity rose 2.4% from a year earlier in the third quarter of 2023, compared with a negative reading two quarters earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, it is in AI that the prospects for a '90s-style technology and productivity boom most likely lie today. But AI's impact on productivity is hard if not impossible to forecast. \"The range of potential outcomes is huge,\" says Draho.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, if worker productivity numbers keep creeping up, look for investors to get more excited about a potential '90s redux.\n",

    "G.O.P. presidential candidates have not aggressively courted Gen Z, even as young voters increasingly show an openness to new candidates and a concern for new ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Vivek Ramaswamy walked out of an event this month at Dordt University, a small Christian college in northwestern Iowa, the school's football players greeted him with bro hugs and a challenge: Could he join one of them in doing 30 push-ups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old entrepreneur and Republican presidential candidate, did not miss a beat.\n",
    "\n",
    "''You guys are probably about half my age or so,'' he said when he was done, having strained only slightly, ''and I'm probably about half the age of everyone else who's making a real dent in American politics today.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of his age and influence, Mr. Ramaswamy is the only Republican primary candidate prioritizing an appeal to young voters. While he targets college campuses and flexes on TikTok, his rivals have largely favored courting older evangelical Christians, farm workers and Chamber of Commerce-style voters over recruiting the next generation of Republicans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be partly a matter of practicality: Historically, younger voters have more often supported Democrats, and a majority have left-leaning views on issues like abortion access and climate change. That holds true in Iowa, where residents of Ames and Iowa City, the state's largest college towns, regularly vote for Democrats. When former President Donald J. Trump attended the Iowa-Iowa State football game this fall in Ames, fans booed him.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, while many Generation Z Republicans, born between 1997 and 2012, grew up during the Trump presidency and say they are sticking by him, interviews with nearly 20 young voters in Iowa indicated that some were ready to move on to other candidates who they believed could more easily beat Mr. Biden, without the personal baggage that has dogged Mr. Trump for years. (In 2016, 12 percent of voters in the Iowa Republican caucuses were between 17 and 29, a small slice that could nonetheless sway a close race.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Eli Harris, a first-year law student at Drake University in Des Moines, said he voted for Mr. Trump in 2020 but now planned to caucus for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.\n",
    "\n",
    "''He can sway moderates,'' Mr. Harris, 24, said of Mr. DeSantis. ''He's not incendiary in the wrong ways. He doesn't tweet out something stupid at 2 a.m.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary Weston, 23, the chair of the Iowa Young Republicans, said she believed that Mr. Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, were connecting with young voters more deeply than Mr. Trump. In November, Ms. Haley won the Iowa Young Republicans National Federation's mock caucus, beating Mr. Trump by nearly 15 percentage points. (Among all voters in Iowa, Mr. Trump still leads his rivals by more than 30 percentage points in most state polls.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, beyond Mr. Ramaswamy, the Republican candidates have taken relatively traditional approaches to courting Gen Z voters. Both Ms. Haley and Mr. DeSantis have networks of student groups who promote their candidacies on college campuses, and they have occasionally dropped by college tailgates. Mr. Trump recently wrote an opinion essay titled, ''I Will Make America Great Again for Young People.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The general disconnect between the candidates and young voters was highlighted at the first Republican debate in August, when the candidates were asked how they would combat climate change, which polls routinely show is a top concern for voters under 30. The candidates quickly turned to spreading misinformation and insulting one another. Not one said how they would address the issue domestically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Young Republican voters in Iowa shared other concerns, including the rise of ''cancel culture,'' especially at universities, where they say they face attacks for espousing conservative beliefs. Some said they were more likely to be accepting of L.G.B.T.Q. rights than their older counterparts, and less likely to support a ban on TikTok.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Not every young Republican agrees with the old G.O.P., straight-ticket kind of deal,'' said Logan Williams, a recent graduate of the University of Iowa who works for Americans for Prosperity, the super PAC that has endorsed Ms. Haley.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Williams, 23, said he was relieved that Ms. Haley had softened her calls to ban TikTok because he believed that ''tech censorship is a First Amendment violation.''\n",
    "\n",
    "On other topics, though, young Republicans appear to be in lock step with older conservatives. Maddy Browne, 26, said she cared deeply about a strong military and a firm presence by the United States on the world stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Keeping our country safe is my No. 1 goal, and having a strong country again,'' said Ms. Browne, who has several relatives who are active service members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many cited fears that inflation and rising housing costs would make it difficult for them to afford their parents' lifestyles. ''Maybe when I was 18, my family took care of that a little bit more, but now I'm dealing with those costs and I'm mad,'' said Armaan Gupta, a 22-year-old senior at Iowa State University.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the Dordt football players, Kolson Kruse, 20, said he supported Mr. Ramaswamy because he was best suited to ''get our economy going again.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Ramaswamy has vigorously tried to show that he relates to students, visiting college campuses and injecting himself into young people's social media feeds -- though his campaign's platform, which calls to raise the voting age, does not always appear to be winning over young people, as he claims. At an event last month near Grinnell College, in Grinnell, Iowa, Mr. Ramaswamy drew several students who said they were Democrats and did not plan to support him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attracting younger voters, no matter the candidate, has long been a challenge for the Republican Party. This month, five members of the Republican National Committee's youth advisory panel resigned, citing a ''lack of confidence we have in the R.N.C.'s ability to win over and mobilize young voters,'' according to a letter first reported by Fox News.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of them -- Joe Mitchell, a former Iowa state legislator who founded Run GenZ, which recruits young conservatives to run for office -- said future success for Republicans hinged on having ''grass roots plans'' to reach young voters with relevant policies and through digital platforms. Mr. Mitchell worries that no such plans exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I talk to a lot of people who weren't historically politically super engaged that are more now,'' said Mr. Mitchell, 26, who is backing Mr. Trump. ''But I'm also not sold that they're educated to show up and vote in November 2024.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In his view, Mr. Trump's celebrity appeal may dispel such concerns. The former president has been able to maintain a base of support among young voters through his digital outreach, leveraging an army of meme-creators who promote him and disparage his rivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even on the issue of protecting ideological diversity on college campuses, which Mr. Ramaswamy, Ms. Haley and Mr. DeSantis have all tried to use to appeal to young voters, many of them still trust Mr. Trump.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue has resonated with Jasmyn Jordan, the chair of Young Americans for Freedom at the University of Iowa, who recently testified to the House Judiciary Committee about the animosity and threats she and other young conservatives said they had received for hosting conservative speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Jordan, 20, praised Mr. Trump for saying he would withhold federal funding from schools that do not support free speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The fact that he actually gives consequences, rather than coddling universities and entities who aren't doing anything to help everyone equally, is something I really admire,'' Ms. Jordan said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, with outreach from candidates' campaigns seemingly haphazard, many Gen Z Republicans have taken it upon themselves to try to reach their peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This month, Ms. Weston's Iowa Young Republicans group hosted a Christmas party for about two dozen young conservatives inside the Stine Barn, a cavernous building in West Des Moines.\n",
    "\n",

    "Protests over the Israel-Hamas war roiled Columbia's campus for weeks. Then, the campus and its president receded from attention -- for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the weeks after Oct. 7, Columbia University was the scene of rising tensions over the Israel-Hamas war on American college campuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jewish student said he was assaulted after putting up posters of hostages. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students accused one another of support for genocide in a series of heated protests and counter-protests.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as the fall semester ended, Columbia faded from the spotlight even as its peer schools, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania in particular, were scrutinized over their responses to the war and claims of antisemitism on campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporters of Columbia's president, Nemat Shafik, credit her diplomatic skills in avoiding a similar public relations crisis. But detractors said she has bent too far to the demands of Israel supporters, angering students and some faculty members but keeping powerful donors and trustees mostly happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "She might also have benefited from a bit of luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Congress invited her to a congressional hearing on antisemitism on Dec. 5 with her peers from Harvard, Penn and M.I.T., Dr. Shafik said she could not go. She told representatives that she had already planned to attend the COP28 climate conference in Dubai, where she introduced a panel about women leaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Congressional hearing did not go well. The University of Pennsylvania president lost her job and the Harvard president became mired in weeks of controversy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But instead of fighting for her job, Dr. Shafik was announcing a new initiative, called Values in Action, in which she called for informed debate, not ''taunts and cruelty.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, she is walking a precarious path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her call for compassion and respect, some students said, does not reflect what they say has been a repressive effort to rein in pro-Palestinian protesters that has gone farther than at other Ivy League universities: In November, Columbia's administration made the extraordinary decision to suspend temporarily two pro-Palestinian student groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I just think the university is not identifying the proper threat,'' said Deen Haleem, a third-year law student and a leader of Law Students for Palestine. ''The current threat right now are the universities that are shutting down pro-Palestine speech.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a spokeswoman, Dr. Shafik, who also goes by Minouche, declined to be interviewed. Her supporters say she has taken a practical approach to the crisis and has done well in addressing different constituencies that are often in conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Board members, including pro-Israel voices, say they are pleased at how the president has maneuvered.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think it's very difficult, but I think she did as well as anyone could have done,'' said Victor Mendelson, a Columbia trustee who supports Israel and Dr. Shafik. ''She's been responsive. She's been out and about on campus and she's been very careful to try to make everyone feel welcome. I mean, everyone who is following the rules, obviously.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Like several of her Ivy League presidential peers, Dr. Shafik was appointed to her role only recently -- in her case, in July. An economist born in Egypt, she has deep experience in handling complex international situations. She is a former deputy governor of the Bank of England and a former deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund. Most recently, she was president of the London School of Economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "While she is known for her support of diversity initiatives, Dr. Shafik's views on politics -- and the way her personal experiences may have influenced them -- can be hard to decipher. Mr. Mendelson said that as Columbia scrutinized her before she became president, the search committee was impressed that she had been ''meticulously nonpartisan'' in her previous job.\n",
    "\n",
    "''One couldn't figure out her personal views because she wanted that evenness on campus,'' he said. ''That's one of the key reasons I was supportive of her candidacy for president.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Two days after the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, Dr. Shafik issued a statement saying she was ''devastated by the horrific attack on Israel,'' adding that ''we must reject forces that seek to pull us apart.'' But in the days that followed, protests became so tense that the university closed its campus to outsiders and postponed a major fund-raising drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, on Nov. 10, it suspended the two pro-Palestinian student groups. According to a statement from Gerald Rosberg, the chair of the school's Special Committee on Campus Safety, the action was justified because the two groups had repeatedly violated university policies requiring them to get permission and give 10 business days' notice before holding an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Student groups criticized the 10-day rule, saying it violated free speech protections. Jaxon Williams-Bellamy, a law student and delegate to the University Senate, said it was ''too onerous and creates a chilling effect.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Columbia administrators said the rule had been in place for years, though it was not always enforced, and that the school was working with the Senate to amend the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Rosberg's statement also cited ''threatening rhetoric'' during one of the groups' demonstrations, but students said they were never informed of what that rhetoric was. One student on the outskirts of a Nov. 9 protest had shouted antisemitic curses, but he was not affiliated with any of the student groups, and was shouted down by the pro-Palestinian protesters, several students said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The university administration later said that the rhetoric was not the cause of the suspension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Shafik's other actions have included creating an antisemitism task force along with a ''Doxing Resource Group'' to help student protesters who face harassment after their identities are revealed online, a tactic that has targeted pro-Palestinian students in particular. She has also gone to interfaith meetings, Hillel events and a Muslim Student Association meeting, and has met with students affected by the war, her office said.\n",
    "\n",
    "She has not, however, met with leaders of the suspended Palestinian groups, student leaders said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new civility initiative is meant to calm the campus through a series of listening forums and training sessions, among other things. The school's 18 deans released a joint letter in support of the program, calling on pro-Palestinian protesters to stop chanting phrases, such as calls for ''an intifada,'' that can be ''experienced by many as antisemitic and deeply hurtful.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Rashid Khalidi, the influential Palestinian historian at Columbia, released a scathing statement in response: ''This statement amounts to a new norm that prohibits using or learning about these terms and their histories, in favor of the privileging of a politics of feeling. While perhaps appropriate to a kindergarten, it is hard to imagine an approach more contrary to the most basic idea of a university.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The letter from the deans also asks students to acknowledge the anguish of pro-Palestinian students mourning the loss of life in Gaza.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ester R. Fuchs, one of the co-chairs of the new antisemitism task force, credited Dr. Shafik with ''lowering the temperature'' on campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Over 300 kids gathered for a Hanukkah candle lighting on campus recently, for example, and you don't hear about it,'' she said. ''There was no incident.'' Claire Shipman, the co-chair of the university's board of trustees, praised the president's calm approach toward crisis management.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We have to focus as a university -- and this is where Minouche is so good -- on moving to a place where people are listening and engaging in conversation, not only protesting,'' Ms. Shipman said.\n",
    "\n",
    "But student organizers see her differently. The request to self-police protest chants feels like a trap and not free speech, said Mohsen Mahdawi, a co-founder of Dar, the school's Palestinian student union.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I am all for compassion and tolerance,'' he said. ''But there should be no double standards. People have to be treated equally with dignity.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Some students predicted that Dr. Shafik's efforts to contain the conflict on campus would only lead to more of it in the coming semester. Columbia's student governing board voted to declare noncooperation with the event policy, the Columbia Spectator reported. Pro-Palestinian groups reorganized and are planning protests under the name Columbia University Apartheid Divest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yoni Kurtz, 21, is a junior studying history and the Hillel student president. He said that while some Jewish students didn't feel comfortable with the tenor of some pro-Palestinian demonstrations, suspending the groups wasn't the right decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There's a real distrust from basically almost any student you talk to of almost anything the administration does or will do, basically no matter their political beliefs,'' he said. ''Most students really just don't believe the administration has their best interest in mind.''\n",

    "The junior senator from California, appointed to serve out the term of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, discussed adapting to the slow pace of the Senate and her goals before leaving office in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Senator Laphonza Butler came to her job in Congress in an unusual way and quickly decided she was not going to stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gov. Gavin Newsom of California appointed Ms. Butler in early October after the death of Senator Dianne Feinstein to serve out the remainder of her term, which ends in 2025. The former Emily's List president, who once headed California's largest labor organization, is not a candidate in the crowded Democratic primary for the 2024 nomination to succeed Ms. Feinstein permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Butler, 44, recently spoke to The New York Times from her Senate office about why she opted not to stay in Congress, where she hopes to focus her attention while she is there and the unlikely areas where she has found commonality with some Republicans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been in office for about two and a half months now. What do you think?\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been a big change, a big shift for me to have your life essentially wholly upset in about 24 hours. It has been a great honor, an incredible responsibility in this moment for our country and for the world. And it has been revelatory in terms of time -- how fast it goes and how slow it goes all at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pace has been the struggle. I know that my colleagues appreciate the challenges that everyday Americans are dealing with, and I think that there is a sense of urgency to solve challenges that are in front of us. The legislative process is much more structured, much more traditional, much slower than anything that I've ever experienced before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just over two weeks after you were appointed to be the junior senator from California, you announced that you were not going to run for a full term. Help us understand why not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was clear to me that I could raise the money. It was clear to me that with a lot of work, I could earn the vote of Californians. So knowing that I could do it was one question. The subsequent question had to be, did I want to do it? And I think serving in elected office is a role you have to want and you have to want deeply. This was never an opportunity that was on my bingo card, and there is no doubt that I want to continue to serve the people of California to use my voice and skill at its greatest capacity. I just didn't want to be a U.S. senator.\n",
    "\n",
    "I knew what I wanted to do was to be a mom to my 9-year-old. What I wanted to do was to continue to be a loud and clear voice on things that I know, communities that I identify with and care about. I say to my daughter all the time, 'There are no nevers.' And so I don't close the door on serving in elected office in the future; I just know that it's not my opportunity at this moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "With just over a year left in office, where do you plan to focus?\n",
    "\n",
    "As I occupy the responsibility of being California's junior senator, one of the youngest senators in the chamber, one of few school-age parents in the chamber, only our nation's third Black woman and 12th Black person right now, the greatest thing that I can do is to create space for generations to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work that we have to do has to be about legislating for our country's future -- issues of housing, challenges of mental health and recovery from a global pandemic, the deployment of incredibly powerful artificial intelligence and the utilization of social media. And they have to be thought about in a way that best centers those who are going to live the longest through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The voices of young people -- millennials, Gen Z and generations that are coming after us -- legislating with those lives in mind, I think is one of the greatest uses of my time here in the Senate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of things that young voters have said to us that are top of mind and that young workers have said to us that are top of mind. So we have a crisis of mental health for young people where data tells us that more young girls are contemplating suicide, that increasingly young people are experiencing deep isolation post-pandemic. Mental health, and particularly youth mental health, is an issue that I want to dedicate some real time and attention to.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to see them as whole people, not just voters when November comes around.\n",
    "\n",
    "When people think about the Senate, a lot of the conversation has been around how old the Senate is. Do you think it's going to be a challenge to bring a focus to youth and young people?\n",
    "\n",
    "Youth issues are American issues. Will it be a challenge? Maybe. It also could be an opportunity. It also could be a way for colleagues to think about how they want to engage young people in their states. It may actually be a place of inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's the saying around here that the people who are closest to the pain have the best solutions. And I think often we forget that even as a young person, a child, they too are close to the pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "My daughter was here in the Senate yesterday, and it hurt my heart to hear her casually talk about the lockdown that happened at her school. It was as if she was talking about coloring class. She was telling one of the staff here in the Senate office about me going to pick her up during a lockdown. And what I hope that we're able to do is to center not only my daughter's story, but the story of America's children, the pain that they are feeling, and that they quietly and casually express that we as adults in their lives have the responsibility to do something about.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm curious what you think the role of Congress is -- and whether you think the institution is fulfilling that role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Um, no. The world is complicated. We are seeing the fragility of our democracy. We are experiencing those who would intend to corrupt the integrity of our institutions, who seek to divide at every opportunity. And I think that Congress is a reflection of that in so many ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are those that I have met who are instruments of that division, who are perpetuators of those things that divide the people of our country. When you have one chamber of Congress who takes three weeks to elect a speaker, who so quickly in their majority, post-'22, advanced three pieces of legislative language and/or resolutions that further take away the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body -- but we had just experienced the unity of the heartland of America, in places like Kansas and Ohio, where the American people are clear about who should be making those decisions -- it's clear that Congress as a whole is not representing the complexity of the moment, the voices of the country in this moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've talked to a lot of members who are retiring or not seeking re-election. And I'm curious if you think that what you just described plays into those decisions to leave -- and did it play into yours?\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be, if I'm being honest with you. I have seen so much happen across the country, in communities and cities and counties and states where the decisions of Washington actually go to get implemented. It starts with, what is this body able to accomplish? Those states and counties and cities don't have the resources or the policy frameworks to really drive or execute their work without members in the Senate and in the House. And so they are not disconnected for me. We need committed advocates, leaders who are also doing the work outside of government to be able to make our democracy truly vibrant and push it forward in a way that advances everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you talk to your colleagues about that frustration?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think there's real knowledge about how frustrated the American people are. It then becomes about how do you listen for what's being said? There are lots of places of commonality. You might not think that California and Alabama have anything to do with each other. But in my conversations, getting to know Senator [Katie] Britt [a Republican] from Alabama, who also has school-age children, I learned Alabama is 47th in the nation when it comes to mental health access. And you compare that with the L.A. Times story that we have 1,800 mental health worker vacancies just in L.A. County -- there is real commonality there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I talked with a young farmer in the Central Valley in California named Nevin, who started his own dairy farm, getting out of the commodities farming that his family came from. And I was in a conversation with Senator [Charles E.] Grassley [a Republican] from Iowa talking about the state of climate change and how water and the lack of water and sometimes the abundance of unplanned water is having an impact on farmers in Iowa. The same dairy cows that Nevin is farming in the Central Valley in California are impacted by those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so seeking to find common solutions in which every American can see themselves is, I think, the greatest opportunity that we have. But it is grounded in the articulation of those frustrations and listening to them, listening to those frustrations and intentionally seeking those places of common ground.\n",

    "\n",
    "Scientists are already busy trying to understand whether 2023's off-the-charts heat is a sign that global warming is accelerating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth is finishing up its warmest year in the past 174 years, and very likely the past 125,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unyielding heat waves broiled Phoenix and Argentina. Wildfires raged across Canada. Flooding in Libya killed thousands. Wintertime ice cover in the dark seas around Antarctica was at unprecedented lows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year's global temperatures did not just beat prior records. They left them in the dust. From June through November, the mercury spent month after month soaring off the charts. December's temperatures have largely remained above normal: Much of the Northeastern United States is expecting springlike conditions this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why scientists are already sifting through evidence -- from oceans, volcanic eruptions, even pollution from cargo ships -- to see whether this year might reveal something new about the climate and what we are doing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One hypothesis, perhaps the most troubling, is that the planet's warming is accelerating, that the effects of climate change are barreling our way more quickly than before. ''What we're looking for, really, is a bunch of corroborating evidence that all points in the same direction,'' said Chris Smith, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds. ''Then we're looking for causality. And that will be really interesting.''\n",
    "\n",
    "As extreme as this year's temperatures were, they did not catch researchers off guard. Scientists' computational models offer a range of projected temperatures, and 2023's heat is still broadly within this range, albeit on the high end.\n",
    "\n",
    "On its own, one exceptional year would not be enough to suggest something was faulty with the computer models, said Andrew Dessler, an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University. Global temperatures have long bobbed up and down around a steady warming trend because of cyclical factors like El Niño, the climate pattern that appeared in spring and has intensified since, possibly signaling more record heat to come in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Your default position has to be, 'The models are right,''' Dr. Dessler said. ''I'm not willing to say that we've 'broken the climate' or there's anything weird going on until more evidence comes in.''\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing researchers will be watching is whether something unexpected might be happening in the interplay of two major climate influences: the warming effect of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and the cooling effect of other types of industrial pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For much of the past 174 years, humans have been filling the skies with both greenhouse gases and aerosols, or tiny particles from smokestacks, tailpipes and other sources. These particles are harmful to the lungs when inhaled. But in the atmosphere, they reflect solar radiation, partly offsetting the heat-trapping effect of carbon dioxide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent decades, however, governments have begun reducing aerosol pollution for public-health reasons. This has already caused temperature increases to speed up since 2000, scientists estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in a much-discussed report last month, the climate researcher James E. Hansen argued that scientists had vastly underestimated how much more the planet would warm in the coming decades if nations cleaned up aerosols without cutting carbon emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all scientists are persuaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments like Dr. Hansen's have been hard to square with patterns in recent decades, said Reto Knutti, a climate physicist at the Swiss university ETH Zurich. In recent years, scientists have also discovered that global warming is shaped not just by how much heat is trapped near Earth's surface but also by how and where this heat is distributed across the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it even harder to conclude with confidence that warming is poised to accelerate, Dr. Knutti said. Until the current El Niño is over, ''it's unlikely we'll be able to make definitive claims,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinning down the precise scale of aerosols' effect has been difficult, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of how aerosols cool the planet is by making clouds brighter and deflecting more solar radiation. But clouds are devilishly complex, coming and going and leaving few traces for scientists to examine, said Tianle Yuan, a geophysicist with NASA and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ''That's fundamentally why it's a hard problem,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, aerosols have been of particular interest because of a 2020 international regulation that restricted pollution from ships. Dr. Yuan and others are trying to identify how much the regulation might have increased global temperatures in recent years by limiting sunlight-reflecting aerosols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Hansen's argument for faster warming leans in part on reconstructions of climatic shifts between ice ages over the past 160,000 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Earth's distant past to make inferences about climate in the coming years and decades can be tricky. Still, the planet's deep history highlights how extraordinary the present era is, said Bärbel Hönisch, a scientist at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fifty-six million years ago, for instance, geologic turmoil added carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in quantities comparable to what humans are adding today. Temperatures jumped. The oceans grew acidic. Species died en masse.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The difference is that it took about 3,000 to 5,000 years to get there'' back then, Dr. Hönisch said, compared with a few centuries today.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then took Earth even longer to neutralize that excess carbon dioxide: about 150,000 years.\n",

    "BRIDGEPORT, Texas -- A shale driller is out to prove that it is possible to go completely green -- while still producing natural gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denver-based BKV says that by the 2030s it will store millions of tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide in wells deep underground to eliminate or offset all of the emissions generated from manufacturing and using its gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that consumers can buy that gas and use it without contributing to climate change, says Christopher Kalnin, BKV's chief executive: \"We called it . . . guilt-free energy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "BKV isn't alone. Companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron are pouring billions of dollars into businesses aimed at capturing and storing carbon emissions -- arguing that such efforts go a long way toward neutralizing the greenhouse gases generated by their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the recent United Nations climate summit in Dubai, many oil producers argued that the world will continue consuming fossil fuels for a long time and that abatement techniques are necessary to meet climate goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two years into its own decarbonization plan, BKV is struggling to keep it -- and its business -- on track, suggesting how tough, costly and time-consuming such efforts are likely to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the past year, as gas prices fell and debts from an acquisition piled up, BKV was poised to breach a debt covenant until lenders agreed to waive it. The company paused plans to go public and got a $150 million capital infusion from its parent, a Thai coal conglomerate. BKV has yet to secure funding for a host of new wells it calculates it will need to hit its zero-carbon goals, a price tag that could go as high as a billion dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kalnin says BKV's carbon plans are still on track and that its financial troubles are bumps in the road as it has rewritten loan covenants. The company was profitable during the first half of 2023, public filings show. Things will improve when gas prices rise and government subsidies kick in, Kalnin says.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Are we squeezed cashwise because of trying to grow a business when gas drops to $2.60? Yeah,\" says Kalnin, referring to the price of a million British thermal units. \"We spent over $60 million building out our carbon-capture business in a declining gas-price market. But it shows our commitment to the business.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Skeptics argue that abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage, or CCS, are expensive boondoggles that aren't nearly as effective in reducing emissions as proponents say, and give energy giants an excuse to continue producing fossil fuels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overreliance on CCS to counteract fossil-fuel emissions is dangerous, the International Energy Agency warned in a November report, potentially requiring an \"inconceivable\" 32 billion metric tons of carbon captured at a cost of more than $3.5 trillion a year until 2050 if current oil-and-gas consumption trends continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon capture got a boost in the U.S. in 2022, when the renewable-energy and drug-cost law known as the Inflation Reduction Act increased tax credits for the practice, but the economics remain unclear and regulations affecting the industry are still being created. Few companies have committed to projects as aggressively as BKV.\n",
    "\n",
    "BKV started pumping CO2 into a well in Bridgeport in November -- one of the first such efforts to get off the ground. If all goes well, the company will reap nearly $18 million a year in government subsidies based on the volume of carbon it injects -- an amount Kalnin estimates could cover the cost of the project in three or four years.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a recent windy afternoon at the well site, Lauren Read, a former Exxon engineer who now heads BKV's CCS business, pointed to a round, white meter with a readout showing how much CO2 is flowing into the ground. \"This is the cash register,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "BKV has contracted to sell gas as well as blockchain tokens tied to carbon-dioxide reductions to the French utility Engie -- one of the first such deals in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kalnin, a former McKinsey consultant, crafted the company's decarbonization strategy during the pandemic, as he read through marketplace surveys. Customers were saying: We want three cars, big houses and cheap, abundant power, Kalnin recalls. But they also didn't want to feel bad about the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kalnin told his staff to crunch the numbers on what it would take to reduce or offset all the emissions associated with both BKV's gas-production operations and the combustion of that gas by its customers -- a target nearly unheard of in the energy industry. That currently totals roughly 15.3 million metric tons of CO2 a year, equivalent to the emissions from the annual energy use of almost two million homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company figured it could eliminate around 7% of that largely by retooling to halt leaks and vents of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, at its 6,000-plus gas wells. BKV is about halfway through that effort now.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the other 93% of its emissions, mostly associated with the burning of its gas, the company settled on CCS. Kalnin took the plan, which had a price tag of $500 million to $1 billion, to BKV's board, which approved it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kalnin started with the easiest project: sequestering the carbon dioxide that is mixed with the natural gas it pumped up from its own wells. That CO2 was being vented into the atmosphere at a processing plant in Bridgeport. Read and her staff designed and drilled the first carbon-sequestration well in 18 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "At full capacity, the well -- a nearly 2-mile-long, concrete- and steel-lined shaft drilled into a layer of porous rock -- will store CO2 from the processing of roughly half of the company's natural-gas output, around 210,000 metric tons of CO2 a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engie is buying all the emissions reductions associated with that storage, so BKV can't use it to offset the footprint of its own operations. BKV will have to tap other companies' CO2 to store in future wells. That could be more difficult, since those companies are likely to want a share in the CCS subsidies as well as the emissions reductions.\n",

    "Political Economics: Worldwide, 2024 Elections Promise a Whirlwind\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It's (almost) election year, baby! Every year is important in its way, and most elections matter to someone. Even so, 2024 promises to be unusually electorally exciting due to the sheer amount of voting across the democratic world -- and over what issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "What seems likely to be an awful U.S. presidential election in November is only part of the story. Hyperventilation about Donald Trump's supposedly authoritarian instincts and well-founded concerns over Biden family corruption will motivate the major parties' bases. But don't lose sight of the global significance of this contest, given the security and economic threats and challenges confronting the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.K. is widely expected to conduct a national election next year (by law it must happen no later than January 2025). On current trajectory, voters' decisions will be determined mainly by the poor state of the economy after 14 years of Conservative Party rule. The next administration will inherit a fiscal mess from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak -- a tangle of suffocating high taxes and unreformed entitlements. Will whoever occupies 10 Downing Street be able to correct those policy errors in ways that foster economic growth while leaving resources available for vital defense investments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Should the Labour Party win, expect leader Keir Starmer to maintain close ties with the U.S. But what sort of relationship would Mr. Starmer cultivate with the European Union? It's a question as in flux as the bloc itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entirety of the EU will go to the polls in June to elect a new European Parliament. It's hard to say what the practical impact of this election might be. The parliament's role in legislating for the bloc often is surprisingly ad hoc, but the political consequences of this election are likely to be substantial. Opinion polls suggest it could be a banner day for protest parties, particularly on the further right end of the spectrum, an electoral warning that might shake decision-making by frightened national governments of all ideological stripes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget Asia. India, the world's largest democracy, is likely to re-elect Narendra Modi as prime minister this spring. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida may be less lucky. His Liberal Democratic Party is in the grip of a fundraising scandal, and although the next national election isn't until 2025, he could be ousted as prime minister in a party leadership vote later in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "And these are only the elections we know are sure or likely -- more are certainly possible. Spain remains in the grip of a constitutional crisis after an inconclusive election last summer. Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had to promise an amnesty to Catalan separatists to win their support for his continued rule, exacerbating the instability attending his attempt to stay in power despite losing the election to the center-right Popular Party. Although Mr. Sanchez will resist to the bitter end, don't rule out the possibility of a snap election to clean up this mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there's Germany. The next election isn't due until fall 2025, and Germans generally are averse to snap polls. But they may not have a choice this time. A November ruling by the constitutional court disallowed the budget gimmick Berlin has relied on to balance the books. The rickety three-party coalition of Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz may not survive the budget battles Berlin now must wage as it juggles a balanced-budget amendment, demands for social-welfare spending, new defense needs and the costs of climate policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, four members of the Group of Seven could end up with new leadership in 2024, plus Spain, plus a major protest vote in the EU.\n",
    "\n",
    "More important still will be what they're all voting about. These elections will represent the first major attempts to grapple with the political challenges of the post-pandemic era. That includes inflation, which hasn't been an electoral issue in most countries (barring the U.K.) for at least a generation. This also will be the first round of elections in at least 15 years in which debates over spending and taxing will happen in the shadow of normal interest rates and the limits such rates impose on governments' ability to borrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voters will also have to reckon with global instability more troubling than anything since the Cold War. Democracies are facing foreign security challenges on multiple fronts (Russia, China, Iran) and across multiple dimensions from the military to the economic. Immigration crises -- most developed countries have one -- may play a big role in driving election results in the U.S. and Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this will be the first major round of elections following what increasingly looks like a high-water mark for the net-zero climate fad. Voters across the West show signs of losing patience with costly and self-defeating energy and industrial policies. Some of these elections could mark the first attempt by newly skeptical electorates to impose their will on their governments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elections always have consequences, but 2024's elections may have more consequences than most. Brace yourselves.\n",

    "WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Part of what sold Setmir and Aida Qose on the World War II-era home they bought last April was something even older: a century-old orange grove across the street.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Summertime, you can smell the oranges,\" said Aida Qose, 49 years old. \"It feels like you are living in the middle of the country.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet her home and the Bothwell Ranch in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Woodland Hills sit only blocks from the busy Ventura Freeway, and the surrounding San Fernando Valley is carpeted with suburban development. A developer plans to build homes and remove most of the trees from the 14-acre farm, which contains the remnants of the valley's last working citrus grove.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We would prefer it stay the way it is,\" Qose said on a sunny day in early December.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trees' removal would mark a quiet end to an era for Los Angeles. The San Fernando Valley was home as early as the 1920s to a more-than-70,000-acre sea of citrus. Suburban sprawl began encroaching, and some growers opted to sell. Profits diminished over time as agriculture's regional footprint shrank and as tougher global competition emerged from places like Brazil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The developer, Los Angeles-based Borstein Enterprises, filed for permission this year from the city to replace 1,100 of the 1,400 mostly citrus trees with a 21-home subdivision. Representatives for the company said they plan to set aside 4 acres as a preserve for the old ranch, including a structure used as a garage and workshop, and leave two rows of orange trees as a buffer along the front entrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "City Councilman Bob Blumenfield said he helped broker the deal in 2022 after his previous efforts fell through to turn the whole orange grove over to a nonprofit preservation group. \"At the end of the day, we found a way to get a third protected,\" he said. \"It is a huge win. This is private property, and they could have sold it off.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal doesn't mollify critics who say the Bothwell Ranch should be preserved in its entirety as precious remaining open space -- and homage to when agriculture was king in the valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is the last of its kind, never to be duplicated,\" said Jeff Bornstein, a local resident and president of the West Valley Alliance for Optimal Living. \"They want to take away this beautiful monument to the past.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bornstein said his group would try to block the project once it gets final approval as expected next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of broader concern is the impact of losing one more significant group of trees on an urban environment like Los Angeles, which like many large cities is vulnerable to rising temperatures from climate change, said Jeanne McConnell, co-founder of Angelenos for Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There is no urgency in addressing the loss of green space all while people are dying of heat in this city,\" McConnell said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brad Rosenheim, a spokesman for the developer, said at least 278 new trees would be planted and there would be green setbacks on the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other opponents cite the colorful history of the ranch, where owner Lindley Bothwell kept a collection of more than 100 classic cars as well as a train track with a steam engine. Celebrities from Walt Disney to Jay Leno have walked its grounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The land for the orange farm was first acquired in 1922 by Sam Bothwell and later acquired by family members including his son Lindley, who sold off chunks to development as the valley's population soared, said John Bothwell, a great grandson of Sam's who now owns many of the old cars including a 1923 Model T.\n",
    "\n",
    "After her husband died in 1986, Helen \"Ann\" Bothwell took over and kept the ranch going, said Alan Clendenen, a fellow car enthusiast and decadeslong visitor to the ranch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her death in 2016 prompted the heirs to put the property up for sale. The ranch had less than $25,000 in revenue that year with water costs alone as high as $50,000 a year, said Andrew Fogg, a lawyer for the family trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly 4,000 people signed a petition to save the grove, and in 2019 Blumenfield proposed the city designate the ranch a historic-cultural monument, which would make it harder to develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fogg said the ranch didn't meet the criteria for a monument because all of its original orange trees had to be replanted in the 1970s and 1980s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having seen little ranch upkeep since Ann Bothwell died, some neighbors said they are happy to see the new plan of homes and a small preserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This particular developer is a very kind person because he is not building as many as he could,\" said Goldie Schon, 60, whose home abuts the ranch. The boards of the local Tarzana and Woodland Hills neighborhood councils have both unanimously supported the new plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, neighbor Judy Braun, 77, said she would hate to see most of the trees go. \"This is a beautiful thing to have in the neighborhood,\" she said.\n",

    "CHICAGO -- Each year, about half a million people pass through Chicago's Greyhound bus station, at all hours. There is a climate-controlled waiting area with bathrooms, security guards and a snack bar, and about three dozen arrivals and departures every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those passengers could soon be out in the cold. The station's owner, an affiliate of hedge fund Alden Global Capital, has put it on the market. The 87,000-square-foot property in the rapidly developing West Loop could fetch more than $30 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential closure highlights a plight confronting millions of travelers, many on lower incomes, that attracts far less attention than passenger rail or aviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intercity bus stations are closing across the U.S. At least eight cities have lost their stations so far, including Philadelphia, Ohio's Columbus and Tampa, Fla. Passengers have had to wait on street corners and parking lots, causing tensions with local officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greyhound's owner, German bus operator Flix, wants cities to help fund new facilities; local officials say that is the company's responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago would be the largest city to lose its terminal. It isn't clear where passengers would wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "Years of declining ridership and company missteps have dragged down the fortunes of Greyhound, a century-old icon of the American road. Its former owner sold its stations to raise cash. Many, in downtown locations, are worth more as something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, Greyhound is leasing back the stations that remain open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intercity bus travel isn't federally regulated. Nonetheless, it plays a vital role for passengers who need cheap transportation or who are traveling to places with no air or train service.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2016 DePaul University study put the number of bus riders at around 62 million a year, roughly twice that of Amtrak. Greyhound, the country's largest operator, carried about a third of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This whole network that serves a whole lot of people, many of whom don't have any alternative, is essentially invisible to our state and federal policy makers,\" said Fred Fravel, vice president of KFH Group, a transportation consulting firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercity bus network allows passengers to reach thousands of destinations on a single, relatively affordable ticket. Greyhound alone makes 2,300 stops. But those trips are only possible where passengers can safely make transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For years, connections happened at Greyhound-owned stations or at public-transit centers. In smaller towns, buses often stop at truck stops or fast-food restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing the stations would make it difficult to change buses, possibly eliminating some routes and jeopardizing the ability to travel cross-country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other operators, such as Megabus, which often pick up passengers curbside, focus instead on point-to-point service with few, if any, transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago officials say they would like to keep a terminal in town but haven't come up with a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's going to be very messed up,\" said Jermaine Haynes, a 48-year-old from Flint, Mich., as he rushed into the Chicago terminal to make his bus to Indianapolis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tampa, where the Greyhound station closed recently, riders had to wait under a highway overpass. In Philadelphia, buses and bus riders first moved to a curb on Market Street, then moved again after neighbors complained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cincinnati lost its bus station last year, after the building was sold to a local real-estate company. Now buses stop in a parking lot off an interstate about 10 miles from downtown. There is a trailer and a bench outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where William Carr, 60, was smoking a cigarette one day in November. He was homeless, he said, and headed to Dayton, Ohio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's a shame,\" said Carr, who has been riding Greyhound for 30 years. \"It used to be a good system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2007, British transportation company FirstGroup paid $3.7 billion for Greyhound. The new owner planned to spruce up buses and stations and develop better online ticketing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But FirstGroup hit obstacles. Budget airlines siphoned off some customers. Gas prices fell, encouraging people to drive. Immigration restrictions by the Trump administration cut into a big market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridership collapsed during the pandemic, and Greyhound's revenue plummeted to $422.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2021 -- down roughly 62% since 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greyhound and Flix served five million riders in the first six months of 2023, the company says. It had 14 million riders the year before the pandemic started, down about a third from 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buses got relatively little public support during the pandemic; $2 billion from the 2020 Cares Act was shared among ferry companies and intercity, charter and school bus operators. President Biden's stimulus included $100,000 to support intercity bus service in rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, Amtrak received almost $4 billion and airlines $54 billion in pandemic assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021, FirstGroup sold Greyhound to Flix for $172 million. But the sale didn't include Greyhound's stations and maintenance facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We were very clear at the time that the focus for FirstGroup was to be on our U.K. businesses,\" said company spokeswoman Jessica Walker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company announced the sale of 15 properties in 2021, netting the company $101 million. The next year, it sold an additional 33, including the Chicago station, to Twenty Lake Holdings, an affiliate of Alden, for $140 million. Neither responded to requests for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kadir Boysan, chief executive of Flix's U.S. operations, says he wants the public sector to help pay for new facilities. \"Local governments can support the construction and operations of intermodal centers that will offer a safe and comfortable space for the buses to board and to drop off passengers,\" he said.\n",

    "The U.S. is racing to overhaul how it powers its cars, trucks, buildings and industries. It has a long way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biden administration is investing hundreds of billions of dollars to cut the country's reliance on fossil fuels and transition to cleaner energy. Getting there is going to take huge infrastructure projects and the development of technologies that once seemed like science fiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the work is just getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric-vehicle sales in the U.S. continue to climb, but still account for a fraction of cars on the road. Wind and solar energy production are ramping up, but fossil fuels still provide a majority of the country's power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the most visible targets of the energy transition are gas-powered cars and trucks. They make up a big part of the transportation sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of U.S. emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is why the Biden administration wants zero-emission vehicles to reach 50% of sales by 2030. In the third quarter, electric vehicles accounted for about 10% of U.S. sales, according to Cox Automotive. Battery electric vehicles made up 8% of that and plug-in hybrids were about 2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Europe, EVs including hybrid plug-ins account for 26% of sales, according to BloombergNEF. In China, the figure is 33%.\n",
    "\n",
    "EV sales in the U.S. are still climbing, but the pace of growth has slowed as startups run into rising costs and manufacturing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with sales surging in recent years, replacing the country's fleet of vehicles is expected to take years.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big challenge in increasing EV sales: Drivers have to be willing to adjust their routines because the cars need recharging. The Biden administration wants to address any hesitancy people might have about convenience by building out the network of public charging stations to 500,000 by 2030. Right now, the U.S. has nearly 160,000 public chargers, according to government data.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much you would need a public charging station -- and how convenient EVs are today -- depends on a variety of factors. These include the car's range, how much you drive each day and whether you can charge your car at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Living near charging stations doesn't guarantee convenience. Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst with S&P Global Mobility, said drivers might arrive at stations to find chargers broken or in use, forcing them to wait a half-hour or more. \"Even in areas where it's really built up, there's been reliability issues,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with gas stations, EV charging stations will likely evolve over many years, according to Brinley.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big target for the Biden administration is the power sector, which accounts for about a quarter of the country's emissions. The Biden administration wants it to be carbon-pollution free by 2035.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fossil fuels -- mostly coal and natural gas -- currently account for about 60% of the U.S.'s electricity generation. Low-carbon sources account for the rest, with renewable energy contributing 21% and nuclear energy 19%. That share is expected to grow as clean-energy projects come online. The country could nevertheless fall short of its goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with all the incentives from last year's landmark climate bill, a recent study found that emissions from electricity generation are projected to fall by 66% to 87% by 2035 -- a steep drop but short of Biden's carbon-free goal. The wide range reflects the many unknown variables that could affect development, such as changes in interest rates, technology costs and permitting challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That makes it difficult to make predictions about the future, with these quickly moving technologies,\" said John Bistline, a co-author of the study and an energy and environmental economist at Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add up all the efforts, and the administration aims to slash U.S. emissions by about half from 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn't just EVs and renewable energy Biden is counting on. The government is also pouring money into developing industries including hydrogen power and carbon removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Startups are taking different approaches to that work, including using giant fanlike devices to pull carbon from the air and absorbing it with materials such as sawdust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such efforts remain in early stages.\n",

    "Extreme weather in the eastern states of Queensland and Victoria this week knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents, the authorities said.\n",
    "\n",
    "At least nine people were found dead in Australia after storms and floods in the eastern part of the country caused power outages and damaged infrastructure over the Christmas holiday period, the authorities said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extreme weather has mainly affected people in the eastern states of Queensland and Victoria. Even as rainfall tapered on Wednesday, search and rescue operations continued in flooded areas, and power crews were trying to restore electricity to tens of thousands of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "''While many Australians are enjoying their well-earned holidays, our essential services and emergency personnel are working grueling shifts to keep the lights on and to keep us safe,'' Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queensland was hardest hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two weeks ago, a storm that ripped through the coastal city of Brisbane, Queensland's state capital, left at least one person dead. But the extreme weather this week -- at least three inches of rain fell in parts of coastal Queensland over a 24-hour period ending Wednesday morning -- was even more deadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Queensland authorities have linked at least seven deaths to the storms, including a woman killed by a falling tree on the Gold Coast, a region south of Brisbane, on Monday and three men whose bodies were found after motorboat carrying 11 people overturned on Tuesday in Moreton Bay, near Brisbane. (The other eight people were rescued.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergency workers also found the bodies of two women during a search operation in a flooded river north of Brisbane, as well as the body of a 9-year-old girl who had gone missing during flooding in a suburb south of the city, the police said on Wednesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 60,000 electricity customers were still without power in southeastern Queensland on Wednesday, according to the energy utility Energex. And in Gold Coast, the mayor said that heavy rain and high winds had damaged about 1,400 homes, toppled trees and power lines, and disrupted the water supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather system that caused the storms in Queensland, which covers more than a fifth of Australia, was clearing on Wednesday night. But heat wave conditions were expected in some areas of Thursday and Friday, along with another possible round of thunderstorms over the weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Victoria felt impacts, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The storms this week also caused damage and death in the southeastern state of Victoria, which includes Melbourne.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two people died when a campground about 200 miles east of Melbourne flooded on Tuesday, the local news media reported. The police confirmed one of the deaths, adding that several vehicles in the campground area were underwater when emergency workers arrived.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separately, a woman and her dog were rescued on Tuesday after being swept downstream in a river in the Melbourne area. Neither was seriously injured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several flood watches and warnings remained in effect across Victoria late Wednesday, even as rainfall in the area let up, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this connected to climate change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every extreme weather event can be immediately attributed to global warming, but scientists have repeatedly warned that heating up the planet will bring higher temperatures, wildfires, droughts and intense rainfall, among other things. An additional risk these days is that El Niño, a natural weather pattern that can play out over several years, will further aggravate weather extremes around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Australia has already experienced a lot of extreme weather in recent months, including a very dry early autumn, a wetter-than-average November and an early-arriving tropical cyclone in December.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as summer begins in the Southern Hemisphere, Australia is heading into wildfire season. Experts say it could prove to be the worst for the country since the deadly blazes of 2019 and 2020, which killed hundreds of people and left tens of thousands of acres charred.\n",

    "\n",
    "Movie audiences flocked to Taylor Swift, ''Barbie'' and ''Oppenheimer'' but were cooler toward returning superheroes like the Flash, Captain Marvel and Aquaman.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hollywood's movie factories run on conventional wisdom -- entrenched notions, based on experience, about what types of films are likely to pop at the global box office.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, audiences turned many of those so-called rules on their heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superheroes have long been seen as the most reliable way to fill seats. But characters like Captain Marvel, the Flash, Ant-Man, Shazam and Blue Beetle failed to excite moviegoers. Over the weekend, ''Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,'' which cost more than $200 million to make and tens of millions more to market, arrived to a disastrous $28 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada. Overseas moviegoers chipped in another $80 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, the biggest movie of the year at the box office, ''Barbie,'' with $1.44 billion in worldwide ticket sales, was directed by a woman, based on a very female toy and spray-painted pink -- ingredients that most studios have long seen as limiting audience appeal. An old movie-industry maxim holds that women will go to a ''guy'' movie but not vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The Super Mario Bros. Movie'' collected $1.36 billion, a second-place result that also stunned Hollywood; studios have a troubled history with game adaptations. ''Oppenheimer,'' a three-hour period drama about a physicist, rounded out the top three, taking in $952 million and contradicting the prevailing belief that, in the streaming era, films for grown-ups are not viable in theaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Without question, change is afoot -- audiences are in a different mood,'' said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. ''The country and the world are not in the same place. We've had seven years of divisive politics, a severe pandemic, two serious wars, climate change and inflation. Moviegoers seem less interested in being overwhelmed with spectacle and saving the universe than being spoken to, entertained and inspired.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest box office surprises of the year fell into the ''spoken to'' category. ''Sound of Freedom,'' a crime drama that cost $15 million to make, catered to the far right, an audience largely ignored by Hollywood, and generated $248 million in ticket sales, on a par with ''The Eras Tour,'' which targeted Taylor Swift fans and also cost about $15 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Sound of Freedom'' came from Angel Studios, an independent company in Provo, Utah, that supported the film with an unorthodox ''Pay It Forward'' program, which let supporters buy tickets online for those who otherwise might not see it. In a big break from Hollywood norms, Ms. Swift cut out the middle company (a studio) and made a distribution deal directly with AMC Entertainment, the world's largest theater operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Our phone has been dancing off the hooks since the day we announced the 'Eras Tour' project,'' Adam Aron, AMC's chief executive, told investors on a conference call in November, referring to ''alternative content'' opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comscore, which compiles box office data, projected on Sunday that North American ticket sales for the year would reach about $9 billion, a 20 percent increase from 2022. (Before the pandemic, North American theaters reliably sold about $11 billion in tickets annually.) The average price for an adult general admission ticket in the United States was $12.14, up from $11.75, according to EntTelligence, a research firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worldwide ticket sales are expected to exceed $33 billion, an increase of 27 percent, partly because of a surge in Latin America. (Before the pandemic, worldwide ticket sales easily exceeded $40 billion annually.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hollywood's climb back from the pandemic is expected to stall in 2024. With fewer movies scheduled for release -- studio pipelines were disrupted by the recent strikes -- ticket sales will decline 5 to 11 percent next year, depending on the market, according to projections from Gower Street Analytics, a box office research firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading box-office tea leaves is like pontificating about symbolism in works of fiction: Any halfway plausible theory works. But studio bosses need something, anything, to guide them as they make billion-dollar judgment calls for the seasons ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are five takeaways from this year:\n",
    "\n",
    "Moviegoers want comfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "People reach for nostalgia in times of stress, and movies that reminded audiences of the past -- while also managing to feel fresh -- have been succeeding. ''Barbie,'' ''The Super Mario Bros. Movie,'' ''The Little Mermaid,'' ''Wonka'' and the retro-feeling ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem'' allowed people to revisit their childhoods. ''Insidious: The Red Door'' hit pay dirt by bringing back the franchise's original stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'' could have tapped into nostalgia to become a hit. Instead, a huffing and puffing Harrison Ford, 81, simply reminded Indy fans that they, too, are getting old. ''Dial of Destiny'' cost Disney $295 million to make and took in a flaccid $384 million. (Theaters keep roughly 50 percent of ticket sales.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Art film has a pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sophisticated dramas with modest budgets and aimed at older audiences have been showing signs of life after two years in the box office I.C.U.\n",
    "\n",
    "The streaming era has forever shifted the bulk of prestige film viewing to the home, analysts say. But theaters found a modicum of success in 2023 with offerings like ''Past Lives,'' a wistful drama with some Korean dialogue, and Hayao Miyazaki's animated ''The Boy and the Heron.'' The bespoke ''Asteroid City'' managed $54 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early box office results have also been promising for Oscar-oriented films like ''Poor Things,'' a surreal science-fiction romance, and ''American Fiction,'' a satire about a writer who puts together a fake memoir that turns on racial stereotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bigger is not better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the past decade, Hollywood has kept audiences interested in sequels by making each installment more bloated and often nonsensical than the last. Bigger! Faster! More!\n",
    "\n",
    "That strategy may need rethinking -- it's just too expensive, analysts say, especially with Chinese moviegoers souring on American blockbusters. ''Fast X,'' the 10th movie in the ''Fast and Furious'' series, cost an estimated $340 million and took in $705 million worldwide, including $140 million in China. By comparison, ''Furious 7'' in 2015 cost $190 million and collected $1.5 billion, including $391 million in China.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom Cruise's seventh ''Mission: Impossible'' spectacle, released in July in the wake of ''Barbie'' and ''Oppenheimer,'' cost roughly $290 million to make and collected $568 million, including $49 million in China. The sixth ''Mission: Impossible'' in 2018 cost $178 million and generated $792 million, with Chinese ticket buyers chipping in $181 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasingly, franchise sequels and spinoffs need to feel fresh to succeed. Lionsgate, for instance, delved deeper into the High Table underground crime organization in ''John Wick: Chapter 4'' and introduced ''Hunger Games'' fans to a new story line (and cast) in the prequel ''The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.'' Both movies were hits. Lionsgate even revived its ''Saw'' horror franchise by shifting the narrative back in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Each of those movies did something different than the prior,'' said Adam Fogelson, vice chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. ''It wasn't just 'spend more, make it bigger, make it louder and cram in more action.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Some audience patterns remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horror continued to be a reliable performer, with ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' and ''M3gan'' starting new franchises for Universal and its Blumhouse affiliate. Together, the two films cost $32 million. They collected a combined $469 million. Also notable was ''The Nun II,'' which cost Warner Bros. about $38 million and took in $268 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superheroes may be down, but they're not out. Marvel's rollicking, well-established ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' series returned for a third chapter and generated $846 million against a $250 million budget. Sony's bold, anime-influenced ''Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse'' cost an estimated $150 million and collected $691 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stars matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional wisdom in Hollywood has been that movie stars are essentially part of the past. A celebrity name above the title no longer carries that much weight with ticket buyers. The underlying ''intellectual property'' is what fills seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "People pay to see Barbie, not Margot Robbie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except that Mattel and various studios tried for at least 20 years to turn the toy into a live-action movie star. It took Ms. Robbie in the role (and Ryan Gosling as Ken) to finally make it happen. Other movies that benefited from star power in 2023 included ''Wonka,'' with Timothée Chalamet, and ''Creed III,'' anchored by Michael B. Jordan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stars don't have heft? Try telling that to the producers of ''Gran Turismo,'' ''Haunted Mansion,'' ''Dumb Money'' and ''Strays,'' all of which disappointed at the box office and arrived when their casts were barred from promoting their work because of the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n",
    "\n",

    "President Biden's climate policy contradictions keep piling up. Witness the family feud that blew up late last week between the renewables lobby and green groups over the Biden Administration's new proposed rules for the Inflation Reduction Act clean hydrogen tax credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IRA created a new tax credit for producing clean hydrogen from low-emissions sources. The climate lobby envisions clean hydrogen someday replacing fossil fuels in airplanes, long-distance trucking, shipping, and steel and fertilizer manufacturing. The dispute is over how the government should define \"clean.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all hydrogen today is made using natural gas as a feedstock. So-called clean hydrogen can also be produced with electrolyzers powered by solar or wind that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. But this method is three times more expensive. It also isn't practical since wind and solar don't provide power 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The renewables lobby says hydrogen producers should be able to claim the tax credit even if their electrolyzers run on grid power generated in part by fossil fuels. Hydrogen producers would then offset those fossil-fuel emissions by buying what are effectively indulgences from solar and wind generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Green outfits complain this scheme would make it too easy to game the tax credit without reducing CO2 emissions. It could even increase emissions because electrolyzers require enormous amounts of power. That means utilities might have to build more fossil-fuel plants to supply other grid customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Treasury Department on Friday sided with the greens. Its 128-page proposed rule for the tax credit would require hydrogen producers to prove they are using power from renewable generators built within the prior three years. The intent is to ensure that hydrogen plants don't indirectly boost fossil-fuel power generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd think the renewables lobby would cheer since this stipulation could increase demand for solar and power generation. But hydrogen producers would also be required to run during the same hours that nearby wind or solar generators operate. That means they couldn't run around the clock and buy indulgences from older renewable plants to offset fossil-fuel grid emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Treasury's proposal also wouldn't let hydrogen producers claim a tax credit if they use power from existing nuclear plants, even though it generates zero emissions and can provide electricity around the clock. Yet the Energy Department is subsidizing three \"clean hydrogen hubs\" that use nuclear power with 2021 infrastructure bill money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under Treasury's rules, few hydrogen projects would qualify for the tax credit. This may be good for taxpayers. But it undermines the Administration's goal of using the tax credit to boost manufacturing and employment in areas that have drawn little green energy investment like Appalachia. \"For an Administration that wants to reduce emissions and fight climate change, it makes no sense to kneecap the hydrogen market before it can even begin,\" West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said.\n",
    "\n",
    "He may be underestimating the Administration's cynicism. The Environmental Protection Agency this year proposed a rule that would effectively require natural-gas power plants to use clean hydrogen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If clean hydrogen doesn't exist in sufficient quantities by the time the rule takes effect, natural gas-fired plants may have no choice but to shut down. The only consistency in the Biden Administration's climate agenda is its desire to harm fossil fuels.\n",

    "Companies wanted 2023 to bring certainty on sustainability disclosures and regulations. They didn't get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, they continue to wait for an array of new and developing rules, including a climate disclosure rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many large companies are preparing to comply with two new climate-related reporting requirements from California -- while navigating a bevy of other new and potential U.S. and international regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"With the multitude of different rules and regulations and a lack of convergence for preparers, it is really becoming the corn maze,\" said Mary Agoglia Hoeltzel, senior vice president of tax at Cigna Group. The Bloomfield, Conn., health-insurance giant is eagerly waiting for the SEC rule, she said at a conference this month in Washington, D.C.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Cigna is looking for answers to questions on the California laws and on the international front: \"We're trying to figure out what they mean by double materiality. . .I'm still struggling with that,\" Agoglia Hoeltzel said, referring to new European Union rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hazy status of rules and regulations presents challenges ahead for chief financial officers and other finance executives trying to determine reporting requirements on environmental, social and corporate-governance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies of all sizes are grappling with unknowns, such as what a business's connection to California has to be to fall within the scope of the requirements, and whether other states will have their own rules on sustainability reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stratification of the varying rules can be mind-blowing, said Agoglia Hoeltzel, who is Cigna's global chief accounting officer. \"And it's making it extremely difficult for companies to be responsive to all of these different requirements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "California in October passed a new set of state disclosure laws set to affect thousands of companies doing business there, which for some businesses came as a surprise, lawyers say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under one regulation, public and private companies operating in the state with annual revenue over $1 billion will have to publicly disclose their greenhouse-gas emissions, including those from their suppliers and customers. Industry groups have fought against the disclosure of these so-called Scope 3 emissions, saying they are hard to reliably measure and costly to report on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn't clear whether the SEC will require companies to report these emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the second California rule, businesses with annual revenue over $500 million will have to disclose climate-related financial risks. The rules, which will take effect over the next several years, could be challenged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internationally, the European Union this year adopted rules requiring sustainability disclosures from EU-listed and non-EU companies doing substantial business in Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The momentum is only building for more rules and regulations. Law firm Kirkland & Ellis partner Abbey Raish expects other states may follow California with their own legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already, New York this year introduced bills that would require certain companies to report on their emissions. \"Companies need to focus on building carbon fluency and compliance procedures for climate information and climate risk strategy into their business process today,\" Raish said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller businesses in particular are likely to be less prepared to comply with California's regulations as well as other developing or new requirements than large public companies that have been getting ready for the SEC's still-to-come rule, attorneys say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, business leaders who haven't thought about emissions from suppliers and customers, such as in restaurant companies, will have to spend a lot of money to get up to speed with the requirements, said Susan Mac Cormac, a partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster.\n",
    "\n",
    "And they will need an independent third party to evaluate and sign off on the data the varying rules require, which will be a significant lift, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, companies are trying to determine whether the two bills California Gov. Newsom signed into law apply to them. \"There's not a lot of guidance yet on what nexus to California means,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large companies are working to keep up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cigna, like many public companies, has been voluntarily reporting on ESG since 2014. Even with roughly a decade of putting out an annual sustainability report, preparing to disclose on ESG in regulatory filings is an undertaking, Agoglia Hoeltzel said.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one, ownership of the report has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In anticipation of the SEC requiring disclosures from public companies, Cigna parceled out the work among several teams -- legal owns strategy, finance oversees compliance, controls and verification of data, and business resources puts the document together.\n",

    "Yes, Billionaires Can Build Cities\n",

    "A company backed by Silicon Valley's most powerful investors, including the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, assembled a land empire outside San Francisco and announced a bold vision to build a brand-new city -- and was immediately castigated by the world's urbanists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critics describe the effort by the company, Flannery Associates, as greed in urbanism's clothing that would create an environmental disaster in the form of a mere commuter suburb. As more details emerge about the ugly tactics used against local landowners, the project appears increasingly likely to drown in its creators' hubris. But beneath Flannery Associates' accumulating mistakes remains an important idea: The Bay Area needs a lot more housing, and we may need privately built cities to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing new about cities built by investors and corporations. Celebration, Fla., was developed by the Walt Disney Company and includes buildings from architectural giants like Philip Johnson and Robert A.M. Stern. (Disney has sold off most of its holdings.) Not far from Seoul, the Songdo International Business District was developed by a consortium of real estate developers; it is planned around a two-square-mile eco-friendly, high-tech downtown that is meant to house over 60,000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also no rule that cities planned by governments are morally superior. In 1910 the mayor of Baltimore, Barry Mahool, signed America's first racial zoning ordinance, explicitly barring Black Americans from moving into majority-white city blocks, leaving the city hypersegregated for decades. During the 1960s, the high-water mark of racial segregation, a private developer named James Rouse planned an integrated city in nearby Columbia, Md. Columbia is not perfect, but it remains racially diverse, and according to data from the Opportunity Atlas, it does vastly better than nearby Baltimore at promoting upward mobility for Black American children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another planned community, the Woodlands in Texas, was born out of the Columbia experience. It offers a powerful example of how a privately conceived city can provide a great deal of public good.\n",
    "\n",
    "George Phydias Mitchell, a pioneer producer of natural gas, was inspired to create the community after attending a symposium hosted by Columbia's developers. He hired many of Mr. Rouse's former employees and even hired a Wharton-trained Lutheran minister to help provide appropriate support for social, particularly religious, activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took 40 years for the population of the Woodlands to grow from 8,400 (in 1980) to 114,000 (in 2020). But patience paid off: The schools-ranking website Niche lists it as one of the best U.S. cities to live in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, with median housing values of $456,400 and median gross monthly rent of $1,723, the development is no longer the bargain that it once was. Still, the prices are a sign that people like it. And while the Woodlands does not share Columbia's history of racial equality, 19 percent of its households are Hispanic, and the Opportunity Atlas shows that upward mobility for low- and middle-income Hispanic children is higher there than in most of Houston.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deng Xiaoping justified China's move to free enterprise by saying that ''it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.'' The California version should be that it doesn't matter if the developer is private or public, as long as it builds the housing that the state needs to become more affordable. Even if these would-be city builders make boatloads of mistakes, getting anywhere close to the goals of Flannery Associates to house 400,000 people -- up to 5 percent of the Bay Area's current population -- would significantly help make the region more affordable and inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building in the Bay Area will enable America to continue its history of allowing people to relocate to more productive places. In the early decades of the 19th century, farmers left the rocky soil of the East for better farmland in the Midwest. A century later, millions of people left agriculture behind in favor of even more fertile economic ground: cities. This huge transition was possible only because cities built vast quantities of housing. In the 1920s alone, New York City added 700,000 units. In recent decades American growth has moved to the Sun Belt, and people are going there not just for the nice weather. As Southern cities like Houston and Atlanta build enough housing to keep prices low, they are siphoning population away from the booming metros of yesteryear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, California is one of the most productive places in the country, but it doesn't let people in because homeowners figured out how to block new construction, which pushes prices up and productivity down. Work by Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti found that limited access to America's most productive places ''lowered aggregate U.S. growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though opponents to development in coastal California often base their arguments on environmental grounds, building there is one of the best things that America could be doing to counter global warming. One of us, Professor Glaeser, and a University of Southern California environmental economist, Matthew Kahn, calculated that coastal California was easily the least carbon-intensive part of the country because of its mild climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flannery Associates effort to build in Solano County, about 60 miles northeast of San Francisco, faces major obstacles that have been compounded by the group's arrogance. The more than 50,000 acres of land the venture has obtained is not zoned for residential use. Securing governmental approval to get the project off the ground will require far more expertise in the workings of democracy than is typically found in Silicon Valley. As the company engages in fierce legal battles with local landowners, who accuse it of strong-arming them and turning family members against one another in the name of rapid land acquisition, it appears that the project is alienating itself from the very allies it would need to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "City building has usually been a collaborative affair that requires openness and thrives on a hive of talent. Without assembling a wide and supportive community, Flannery Associates is on the way to suffering the same fate as Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet company that failed to build a futuristic city in Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a city built by Silicon Valley moguls will succeed only if it puts people before buildings. There are city-building entities, like the Woodlands, that have developed the social muscles to create community, but they don't emerge overnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even if Flannery Associates ends up in failure, we shouldn't forget that private hands have built great cities. The Woodlands shows us that support from private capital can play a productive role in creating communities. Solano County is close enough to San Francisco that the area can meaningfully expand the housing stock in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving it a try is better than the status quo. Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water.\n",
    "\n",

    "Jogging in a T-shirt in Minnesota in December? A scientist called the rare string of balmy days ''a visceral feeling of what climate change looks and feels like.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucy Wallace, a recent transplant from San Diego, had been warned about the bone-chilling winters of her new hometown, Minneapolis. She bought a $900 winter coat, two pairs of boots and metal spikes to make her running shoes usable on icy sidewalks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So she was at once befuddled and relieved by the record-breaking warm temperatures that made for a rare snowless winter holiday week in much of the upper Midwest.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I spent hundreds of dollars on a new wardrobe and winter gear that so far has gone totally unused,'' said Ms. Wallace, 35, who ran five miles on Christmas Day wearing a T-shirt. ''Here I am wearing my San Diego wardrobe in December in Minneapolis.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A high of 54 degrees made this Christmas Day the warmest on record in the Minneapolis area, according to the National Weather Service. Across much of the region, people contended with a string of days heading into the new year that felt like a mild autumn. Ice fishing was particularly perilous on lakes covered by thin ice caps.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a hack to host large holiday gatherings was foiled. ''Thinking of all the Minnesota families who rely on using the porch as an extra freezer during Christmas entertaining when it's almost 50 degrees outside,'' Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota's lieutenant governor, wrote on Threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not unprecedented to have a warm or snowless Christmas in Minnesota. But such days are likely to become increasingly common because of climate change, said Jessica Hellmann, director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's a big cultural shift to experience 50 yesterday and how disorienting that is from a geographic perspective,'' Dr. Hellmann said in an interview on Tuesday. ''It's a visceral feeling of what climate change looks and feels like for people who are accustomed to living in a particular climate.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In northern Minnesota, emergency personnel have warned people to stay off lakes, which are covered by an unusually thin layer of ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, a Cessna plane that landed on Upper Red Lake broke through the ice, according to Jason Riggs, the Beltrami County sheriff.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Upon landing, the absence of snow resulted in the plane having difficulty slowing down,'' he said in a statement. ''Eventually the plane slid into an area of thin ice and the nose of the plane broke through into open water.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The plane's two occupants, who had flown from Michigan for a day of ice fishing, were rescued.\n",
    "\n",
    "In nearby Becker County, a 67-year-old man was found dead on Saturday after his ATV cracked through thin ice, according to the Becker County Sheriff's Office.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted Bonde, the president of the Wisconsin Interscholastic Fishing Association, said ice-fishing competitions in much of the state had been pushed back at least a week as wintertime anglers waited impatiently for the cold to set in.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I know nature is doing this and it's going to turn around at some point; it's just a matter of time,'' Mr. Bonde said, adding, ''Once it happens, there's going to be a mad rush to get out there.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Bonde, who coaches the high school fishing team in Kiel, Wis., about 45 miles south of Green Bay, said that on Dec. 10, there were three inches of ice -- enough to walk on -- in his area. No longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's all gone,'' he said. ''Everybody is getting their boats back out where there used to be ice.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Milwaukee, which has recorded seven days above 50 degrees so far this month, is on track for its warmest December and its warmest year on record, according to Cameron Miller, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Milwaukee.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Christmas Day, the high was 52 -- far above the average high of 34 -- and it only dipped down overnight to 48, the warmest low temperature on record for the date, Mr. Miller said.\n",
    "\n",
    "With ''only a trace'' of snow this month, it has not been an ideal season for winter sports. ''I am an avid cross-country skier, and this kind of weather is abysmal for someone like me,'' Mr. Miller said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, said he had enjoyed taking his daughter to the playground in late December, a month later than in years past. An avid runner, he has appreciated the absence of snow and ice on trails and sidewalks. But there is something deeply unsettling about his first snowless Christmas in Minneapolis, said Mr. Frey, who has made fighting climate change a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Any enjoyment of the warmth is overshadowed by concern for what's going on,'' Mr. Frey said. ''It's a very eerie and disconcerting kind of enjoyment because it makes you wonder what's yet to come.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The unseasonable warmth was expected to shift east on Tuesday and Wednesday, with high temperatures climbing 10 to 20 degrees above normal from the Upper Midwest across the Great Lakes, according to the National Weather Service. Mild temperatures were also forecast along the East Coast, with highs in the 50s in the Mid-Atlantic and temperatures in the 60s in the Carolinas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists say it is hard to attribute a single anomalous weather event to climate change. But there is no doubt that winters in the United States have become milder in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also among the casualties of this year's balmy winter is the Minnesota Ice Festival, which features a giant maze of ice and snow. It was canceled last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The weather hasn't cooperated, and we won't be able to deliver the experience we had hoped for,'' Robbie Harrell, the chief executive of Minnesota Ice, said in a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "One upside of this strange winter is the absence of a particular type of constituent complaint that starts as early as November, Mr. Frey said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We are super proud of our record low in snow plowing complaints,'' he joked. ''Our plow drivers have been so fast and effective; they've been trying out a new strategy and it's clearly working.''\n",

    "French Celebrities Defend Depardieu as Victim of 'Lynching' Over Sex Claims\n",

    "\n",
    "In a public letter, dozens of actors, directors and other celebrities said he was the victim of a ''lynching,'' as he faces allegations of sex crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 50 actors, artists and other celebrities in France have issued a letter ardently defending Gérard Depardieu, the actor accused of sexual harassment and assault, calling him the victim of a ''lynching'' and arguing that he should be able to continue working despite a storm of criticism.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We can no longer remain silent in the face of the lynching that has descended upon him, in the face of the torrent of hatred that is being heaped upon his person, without nuance,'' they declared in the letter, which was published on Monday by the newspaper Le Figaro. The letter was signed by 56 people, some of them prominent cultural figures, and other lesser-known personalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "They included the actresses Nathalie Baye, Charlotte Rampling and Carole Bouquet -- one of Mr. Depardieu's former partners -- as well as the actors Jacques Weber and Pierre Richard; Roberto Alagna, the opera tenor; Carla Bruni, the singer and former first lady of France; and Bertrand Blier, the director whose 1974 film ''Going Places'' vaulted Mr. Depardieu to fame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The letter came less than a week after President Emmanuel Macron of France mounted his own staunch defense of Mr. Depardieu and condemned a ''manhunt'' against him, prompting swift shock and bewilderment from French feminists.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the accusations against Mr. Depardieu have been growing for years, much of the criticism against the actor was recently blown into the open by a French television documentary that aired this month on France 2 television. The documentary showed Mr. Depardieu making extremely crude sexual and sexist comments during a 2018 trip to North Korea.\n",
    "\n",
    "In interviews with the media this year, over a dozen women have accused him of groping, harassing or sexually assaulting them and making inappropriate sexual remarks. He has been charged with rape and sexual assault in one case, involving Charlotte Arnould, a French actress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Depardieu, 74, has categorically denied any wrongdoing, and he has not been convicted in connection with any of the accusations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a rare public comment, Mr. Depardieu told RTL radio on Tuesday that he had not initiated the letter published in Le Figaro or asked for any expression of public support. But he said he had seen the letter ahead of publication and approved of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think those who signed it were very brave,'' said Mr. Depardieu, who was once France's most prominent leading man.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making no mention of the recent documentary or of the women who have accused Mr. Depardieu, the letter praises him as ''probably the greatest of actors'' and as a ''genius'' who has made France shine worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "''When one attacks Gérard Depardieu in this way, it is art that one is attacking,'' the letter said, arguing, as Mr. Macron did last week, that Mr. Depardieu was presumed innocent.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the letter went far beyond an expression of sympathy for the embattled actor or a reminder that French courts had not ruled against him. Instead, it made a fervent plea for him to continue acting and filming.\n",
    "\n",
    "''To go without this great actor would be a tragedy, a defeat,'' the letter insists. ''The death of art.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The letter was yet another sign of the complicated reaction to the #MeToo movement in France.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, a letter signed by more than 100 French women, including the actress Catherine Deneuve, argued that supporters of the #MeToo movement had gone too far by publicly prosecuting private experiences and creating what it called a totalitarian climate detrimental to artistic creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The #MeToo reckoning with sexism has been hailed by French feminist groups. But it continues to fuel worries that the country is importing from America what some believe are puritanical sexual mores and ''cancel culture'' -- a view that has been challenged by younger generations of French actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emmanuelle Dancourt, the president of #MeTooMedia, a group that advocates against sexism and sexual violence in the media, said on Tuesday that this generational gap was on clear display with the letter in Le Figaro, which was signed almost exclusively by people over 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's ''the old movie world,'' Ms. Dancourt told the BFMTV news channel, adding that she was ''appalled because I feel like there is a misunderstanding.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''On the one hand I understand what they are trying to do, they love Gérard Depardieu, they admire the actor -- but so do I,'' she said. ''There are many movies with Gérard Depardieu that I like a lot, we aren't saying we have to cancel his movies and all that he has done.''\n",
    "\n",
    "But ''acts denounced by victims'' must also be taken into account, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The France 2 documentary that aired this month includes interviews with four women who accuse Mr. Depardieu of inappropriate comments or sexual misconduct, including Ms. Arnould and Hélène Darras, an actress who says he sexually assaulted her on a 2008 film set and who filed a suit against him in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the documentary also kicked up a new storm of criticism of the actor because of the previously unseen footage of Mr. Depardieu on a 2018 trip to North Korea, where he had been invited for the country's 70th anniversary. In it, Mr. Depardieu repeatedly blurts crass comments about women, sometimes to their face, using graphic language to describe their physical appearance and to refer to their genitals and to his own.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Go ahead, take the picture while I touch the ass,'' Mr. Depardieu says in one scene where a guide takes a picture of him with several people, including a woman sitting next to him.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the documentary, Mr. Depardieu uses explicit sexual language about a girl, who the documentary says is about 10 years old, riding a horse. Mr. Depardieu's family had accused the documentary of misleadingly editing that specific scene, but France Télévisions said last week that there was ''no doubt and no ambiguity'' about the images and that they were authenticated by an expert review of the raw footage.\n",

    "A proposed export terminal on the Louisiana coast highlights the tension between economic growth, geopolitics and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a marshy stretch of the Louisiana coastline, a little-known company wants to build a $10 billion facility that would allow the United States to export vast stores of liquefied natural gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporters of the project, known as CP2, say the export terminal would be a boon for the United States economy and help Europe decrease its reliance on gas imported from Russia. They also claim that because burning natural gas produces fewer planet-warming emissions than burning coal, the project is a good thing for the climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a nationwide movement is working to stop the export terminal from ever being built.\n",

    "Opponents, including major environmental groups, scientists and activists, say that CP2 would lock in decades of additional greenhouse gas emissions, the main driver of climate change. They add that the project would be harmful to the people who live in the area, as well as the fragile ecosystem that supports aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be up to the Biden administration to decide whether or not the project moves forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the coming months, the Energy Department is expected to rule on whether the export terminal is in the ''public interest,'' a subjective determination that could have far-reaching consequences for the country's natural gas industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision forces the Biden administration to confront a central contradiction within its energy policies: It wants nations to stop burning the fossil fuels that are dangerously heating the planet and has heralded a global agreement reached in Dubai earlier this month to transition away from fossil fuels. But at the same time, the United States is producing record amounts of crude oil, is the leading exporter of liquefied natural gas and may approve an additional 17 export facilities, including CP2.\n",
    "\n",
    "As President Biden seeks re-election, the politics are complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has made climate action central to his presidency and he needs young climate voters to turn out. But he is also trying to keep gas prices from rising, wants to supply European allies with a replacement for Russian gas and must fend off Republican accusations that he is hampering American energy development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In interviews, members of the Biden administration said they were trying to thwart climate change, but also acknowledged the many strategic complexities in play. Ali Zaidi, Mr. Biden's national climate adviser, declined to say whether the administration supported an expansion of liquefied natural gas exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We need to, as part of our overall climate approach, transition globally away from fossil fuels,'' he said when asked whether approving new natural gas export facilities undermined the administration's climate goals. ''And we continue to be diligent about ways to grow the economy, to strengthen our energy security, to boost U.S. manufacturing, create jobs and meet that climate imperative.''\n",
    "\n",
    "To environmental groups, the conflict is clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There is increasing public recognition that this project and others stand as the biggest new carbon sources in the world, and this is in the wake of an iconic global agreement that it is time to transition away from fossil fuels,'' said Manish Bapna, chief executive of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''This disconnect is capturing the public's imagination and outrage.''\n",
    "\n",
    "At the center of the debate is Calcasieu Pass 2, a proposed export terminal that would be situated along a shipping channel that connects the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Charles, La. The company behind the project, Venture Global LNG, is a Virginia-based start-up with two other new Louisiana facilities, one of which is completed but is not yet fully operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "The export terminals represent the culmination of America's decades-long boom in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Starting on a major scale 20 years ago, new methods unlocked huge reserves of natural gas, transforming the country's energy landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in 2016, the United States began exporting liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., and this year became the biggest exporter in the world. Several new terminals are under construction, and even without CP2, exports are poised to grow by more than 50 percent in the years ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exports have given Washington new leverage on the world stage, allowing the Biden administration to impose sanctions on a new Russian Arctic gas project without threatening to raise global energy prices and to help power Europe as it weans itself from Russian gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of CP2 are quick to point out its strategic benefits. In a letter to American regulators urging the approval of the project, a state-owned German gas company said the proposed facility was ''vital for Germany's energy security in the new environment, where gas pipeline supplies from Russia have stopped.''\n",
    "\n",
    "They warn that an escalation of hostilities in the Middle East could threaten transit through the Strait of Hormuz, the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, where nearly a quarter of the global natural gas supplies flow, making such projects all the more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "''You're going to have every ambassador in Washington from countries that rely on American L.N.G. making the case,'' said Charif Souki, the founder of Cheniere, the first major liquefied natural gas export company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane, is cleaner than coal when it is burned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Michael Sabel, the chief executive of Venture Global LNG, said in an interview that natural gas was ''the greatest tool the world currently possesses to combat climate change.''\n",
    "\n",
    "But while natural gas burns cleaner than coal, methane emissions are 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over the first 20 years in the atmosphere. And although methane dissipates more rapidly than other greenhouse gases, it can leak anywhere along the supply chain, from the production wellhead to processing plants to the stovetop. The process of liquefying gas to make it suitable for transport is incredibly energy intensive as well, creating yet more emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new analysis by Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell, concluded that the emissions associated with exporting natural gas could be 24 percent to 274 percent greater than those associated with burning coal. Citing that study, which has not yet been published in a scientific journal, some activists claim that approving CP2 would result in emissions 20 times greater than those associated with the Willow project, a major new oil drilling development in Alaska that the Biden administration approved this year despite an outcry from environmentalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Howarth's analysis is the latest in a growing body of research that has found that natural gas can be just as damaging as coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, in terms of climate impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas executives and some other experts say that Mr. Howarth's claims are exaggerated. ''Maybe you can find a case where the use of L.N.G. is terrible with methane emissions or where an L.N.G. facility could be worse than coal,'' Mr. Souki said. ''But that's the exception, not the rule.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Since early September, activists have lit up TikTok and Instagram, delivered petitions to the Biden administration and met directly with senior White House climate officials to urge Mr. Biden to reject CP2. Jane Fonda recorded a video for Greenpeace calling on the public to work against the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We have enough gas and export terminals to supply everything in the world right now,'' said Naomi Yoder, a staff scientist at Healthy Gulf, one of many local groups working to stop the construction of new natural gas infrastructure in the area. ''There is no need for additional facilities.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The same activists were enraged at Mr. Biden this year after he approved the Willow project. But this time, they are hoping to bring another fossil fuel fight to the front steps of the White House and receive a different result.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The scale of this, it's the single biggest remaining fossil fuel expansion on planet Earth,'' said Bill McKibben, an environmental activist who is leading a campaign to block CP2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Congressional Democrats are also calling on the Biden administration to stop rubber-stamping new fossil fuel projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "''America is drunk on oil and gas production and exports,'' Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said this month after global leaders at the United Nations climate summit agreed to transition away from coal, oil and gas, calling on the administration to ''end approvals of new infrastructure for fossil fuels.''\n",
    "\n",
    "And Democratic members from the House and Senate last month called on the administration to rethink the way it approves natural gas projects, taking into account all of the emissions associated with the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum continued to build this month, as a group of more than 170 scientists called on the administration to block CP2.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Young people are right to raise their voices,'' Mr. Zaidi said. ''We hear these concerns and share them. President Biden's climate agenda isn't just massively ambitious, it's ever-accelerating -- moving faster and faster to meet the moment and transition away from fossil fuels.''\n",
    "\n",
    "CP2 is still awaiting several approvals, including air and water permits from the state of Louisiana, a blessing from the Army Corps of Engineers, and a pair of critical federal sign offs. The most consequential of those, and the one that activists believe they have the best chance of blocking, is the Energy Department's decision about whether the project is in the public interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor in that determination is an evaluation of the fossil fuel emissions associated with building the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Energy Department has never rejected a proposed natural gas project because of its projected environmental impact. But activists are petitioning the Biden administration to use a new methodology to calculate what they call the ''full life cycle'' of planet-warming emissions associated with building and operating the terminal, taking into account, for example, how much methane leaks when the natural gas is extracted and transported to the terminal, and the emissions associated with shipping the gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should the Energy Department use such a framework to make its assessment and decide against approving CP2, activists see an opportunity for a far broader victory than simply killing one infrastructure project. Such a ruling, they say, could effectively end all new plans to export the United States' natural gas, including 20 other similar terminals that are lined up waiting for approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "''An expansion of L.N.G. exports is completely at odds with the climate goals that this country has set out, and is totally inconsistent with the signals coming out of Dubai,'' Mr. Bapna of the Natural Resources Defense Council said. ''The U.S. signed an agreement about the need to transition away from fossil fuels, and now the U.S. needs to demonstrate leadership.''\n",

    "\n",
    "No one can predict with certainty what we will eat and drink in the new year, but multitudes try.\n",
    "\n",
    "As my own end-of-the-year ritual, I sift through an avalanche of predictions from big food companies, PR firms, restaurant groups and market researchers. And then I get on the phone, interviewing the best prognosticators in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not interested in the next viral chickle or what will replace almond moms and girl dinners. Instead, I study small cultural, media and economic data points and watch the trend emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's up for 2024? ''I'd call it hi-lo,'' said Andrew Freeman, president of AF & Co., the San Francisco consulting firm that for 16 years has published a popular food and hospitality trend report in conjunction with the brand and marketing firm Carbonate. ''There is this desire for boldness and maximalism and collaboration, but with this sense that whatever I spend, I need to feel real value for my money.''\n",
    "\n",
    "People want high-quality ingredients, but they also want value -- especially members of Generation Z, who are emerging as sensible and skeptical cooks and diners who want safe rewards wrapped in adventure.\n",

    "''A lot of it is, 'I just want this fantastic experience to take us away from what's happening on the news,''' said Jennifer Zhou, who helps lead the flavor and color team at the global food processor ADM.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there has to be a value proposition, said Sally Lyons Wyatt, who analyzes shopping and consumption trends for the market research firm Circana. ''There are absolutely levers people will be pulling next year in order to manage the wallet,'' she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what to watch for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snack Hype\n",
    "\n",
    "Meals are so 2023. Next year will be all about snacks. Small, delicious bites are a low-stakes way to explore new cuisines. They're a canvas for cultural hybrids like shawarma crunch wraps. And snack collabs will continue to drop like sneakers. (French's mustard and Skittles? Milk Bar and Taco Bell?) ''Snacks can be the ultimate lowbrow cool,'' said Claire Lancaster, who forecasts food and drink trends for the consumer trend forecaster WGSN.\n",

    "Hydration Never Takes a Vacation\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is going to be bigger than ever. #WaterTok -- essentially millions of people watching other people add syrups and powders to giant tumblers of water -- doesn't seem to be slowing down. Look for an uptick in water sommeliers, the ''premium hydration'' category, and wearable hydration sensors. New ways to use waste to make water will pop up, like cacao water from what's left after the cocoa bean is harvested. Water stewardship will matter more, with consumers looking for food and drinks that require less water to grow or produce like dry-farmed beans, snacks made with nopales and beer from companies that use a pond filtration system.\n",

    "''It's gonna be buckwheat's year,'' said Cathy Strange, the Whole Foods Market ambassador of food culture. During a recent trip to Norway, she had a foie gras terrine with a crunchy layer of buckwheat. In New York City, buckwheat is starring in hot chocolate and coating monkfish dressed in curry vinaigrette. It's being spiced with chai or vanilla and turned into drinks. For the climate- and health-minded, buckwheat is a great cover crop and rich in protein and fiber. Of course, fans of soba noodles and blinis aren't surprised.\n",

    "Thought espresso martinis were special? Meal-flavored cocktails would like a word. Through the magic of fat-washing, clarification and infusions, umami-heavy drinks that taste like specific dishes will proliferate as our collective palate shifts from super sweet to savory. Already, in New York you can order a cocktail that tastes of Waldorf salad at Double Chicken Please in New York or a Caprese martini at Jac's on Bond. Or would you prefer a Thai beef salad drink from the Savory Project, in Hong Kong, or an Everything Everywhere cocktail with smoked salmon-infused gin, vermouth and caper brine accented with everything bagel spice from the Anvil Pub and Grill, in Birmingham, Ala.?\n",
    "\n",
    "Got to Be Real\n",
    "\n",
    "Concern over what it takes to create food from elaborate processing methods will explode. ''Ultra-processed'' will continue its rise as a toxic food phrase, according to a Mintel's 2024 global food and drink trends report. Natural fermentation, cold-pressed oils, burgers from nuts and legumes and good, old-fashioned ingredients like butter and cream will have cachet. Corollary: Ingredient descriptions will become more transparent and detailed (instead of ''spicy citrus,'' you may see ''pomelo and habanero'') and include more biodiversity bona fides, but not in the precious farm-to-table way. ''It doesn't always have to be so worthy,'' Ms. Lancaster said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Heat\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat will move from brain-exploding to nuanced and multidimensional, getting paired with sweet and sour flavors or being coaxed from layering flavors from different peppers from different parts of the world. ''It's not just ghost pepper coming at you,'' Ms. Strange said. ''It's more about the complexity and what you can create with it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology of the Year (Maybe)\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence will be a big part of the conversation, although many in the food business have NFT-level skepticism about the hype. Some of the changes AI might bring won't be obvious to consumers, like tighter supply chains, food waste reduction in large kitchens and precision farming techniques. But others might, like new ways to save time in the kitchen or make dining out more enjoyable. One AI-driven system, for example, allows a waiter to simply converse with a guest and send the order enhanced with information about the customer's preferences to the kitchen with voice AI and an earbud, said Simon de Montfort Walker, executive vice president and general manager of Oracle Food and Beverage & Central Industry Solutions.\n",

    "The color expert Pantone declared peach fuzz the color of the year, and several food prognasticators followed and endorsed peach as flavor of the year. Others say flavors like cherry blossom and violet will dominate. Wildflowers will abound. It's all about lightness, femininity and new metrics that include kindness, altruism and cooperation. Consider the viral appeal of hwachae, with fresh fruit, strawberry milk and Sprite over ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dish of the Year: Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "Soup is bone broth's more interesting younger sibling and the perfect vehicle for cross-cultural mash-ups, like menudo tonkotsu ramen. It's also an easy way to dip into the rising popularity of food from Cambodia, Singapore and Indonesia. For cooks, it's a low-risk, forgiving way to experiment with new flavors and ingredients. Soup uses up vegetables that might otherwise get tossed. The Specialty Food Association's trend spotters predict more soup and soup starter mixes on grocery shelves. And soup is yet one more way to soothe ourselves. ''Honestly,'' said Jenny Zegler, Director of Mintel Food and Drink, ''I wouldn't be mad if 2024 was the year of soup.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Other trendlets: Philadelphia as a food town. The continued reign of pickled things. Desserts using sweetened condensed milk and meringue (but not necessarily at the same time). Pistachio everywhere, both the color and the nut. Products that embrace menopause and women's health. Breadfruit. Shrimp toast in new and creative forms. The sour taste of tamarind and calamansi.

    "Electric Vehicle Charging Network Is Years Away\n",

    "\n",
    "Lawmakers approved $5 billion for states to build a network of fast chargers two years ago. Although some states have made progress in recent weeks, most have not yet awarded contracts or started construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than two years ago, lawmakers approved billions of dollars to build out a national electric vehicle charging network in the hopes of encouraging more drivers to switch to cleaner cars. The money, included in the bipartisan infrastructure law, was intended to help assure drivers they could reliably travel longer distances without running out of power.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a robust federal charging network is still years away. Only two states -- Ohio and New York -- have opened any charging stations so far. A handful of others have broken ground on projects in recent weeks, with the aim of completing them in early 2024. In total, 28 states, plus Puerto Rico, have either awarded contracts to build chargers or started accepting bids for projects as of Dec. 15. The rest are much further behind on starting construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broad availability of chargers is critical for the Biden administration's goal of getting electric vehicles to make up half of new car sales by 2030. Americans routinely cite ''range anxiety'' as one of the biggest impediments to buying an E.V. About 80 percent of respondents cited concerns about a lack of charging stations as a reason not to purchase an electric vehicle, according to an April survey from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biden administration is trying to entice consumers to buy electric vehicles both by offering tax credits of up to $7,500 and promising to build out a national backbone of high-speed chargers. That network is meant to give drivers the assurance that they could reach a reliable charger every 50 miles along major roads and highways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The White House has set a goal of building a national network of at least 500,000 public chargers by 2030, but researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have projected that the country will need more than one million public charging ports by the end of the decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ben Shapiro, a researcher at RMI, a nonprofit that promotes the energy transition, said the country needed to accelerate the pace of new charging infrastructure considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "''People certainly have this perspective that there isn't enough charging,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''And that I think does hamper people's interest in E.V.s.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric vehicle sales have been climbing faster than any other major category of automobile, with the nation on track to hit more than one million sales for the first time this year. President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, has also spurred a surge of investment in electric vehicle production across the country. But demand has not grown as much as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some state transportation officials said the rollout has taken more than two years because they had little experience building chargers and it has been challenging to navigate new federal requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tennessee, officials started reviewing bids for contracts after closing applications last month. Preston Elliott, a deputy commissioner of the state's transportation department, said he thought Tennessee was moving quickly, but it still took officials about two years to get to that stage, in part because they had to submit two plans to the federal government and wanted to have conversations with stakeholders before opening bids.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Federal funds come with lots of requirements and lots of strings,'' Mr. Elliott said. ''I've been doing this for about 30 years, and this is the first time I've ever encountered a program where you've had to do so much planning before you spend a penny.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Transportation Department issued final rules for the program early this year, outlining technological requirements and standards that have to be met. Chargers must be within a mile of an interstate exit or highway and have four ports that are all operational and meet minimum power levels 97 percent of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the law gave states flexibility to determine how to award contracts and dole out funds, resulting in varying degrees of progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ohio became the first state to open a charger funded by the new program earlier this month. Mike DeWine, the state's Republican governor, cited charging concerns as a primary reason for getting the system up and running. There are about 43,200 electric vehicles registered in Ohio.\n",
    "\n",
    "''This industry is not going to develop unless people think they have places where they can charge their car,'' Mr. DeWine said. ''We want to send the signal that not only are we getting companies in here that are building things for the future, but we want our consumers in Ohio to have the ability to benefit from that.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Six more charging stations are being designed and expected to begin construction in the next month or two, state officials said. Officials expect to build about 50 charging stations by the end of 2026 to meet the program's requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most states are well behind Ohio and New York. While some are bidding out contracts to build the network, the actual installation of all of the chargers can take years to finish because projects have to clear environmental reviews and other bureaucratic hurdles in addition to the construction, state officials said. Some states are also building chargers in several phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "''If you were talking about building a sidewalk, we build sidewalks all day long,'' said Mr. Elliott of Tennessee. ''When you start talking about a charging system, being open 24/7 and meeting certain power thresholds, I mean, think about the complexities of that.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Elliott said state officials were planning to fund 32 charging stations to meet the program's requirement and aimed to complete those projects in two years once contracts were awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some states with sparse populations and little charging infrastructure have also taken longer to roll out their programs. In Wyoming, the state's transportation department began accepting responses this month from potential station owners to better gauge interest in using the federal funds, which can cover up to 80 percent of the project's cost, plus operating expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "State officials said they did not know when or if they would award contracts because that would depend on the level of interest. Keith Fulton, an assistant chief engineer at Wyoming's Transportation Department, said the process was taking more than two years partly because the department has never installed an electric vehicle charger before.\n",
    "\n",
    "States are also considering the types of connectors they will need. Although they only have to provide ports with Combined Charging System connectors, some states, such as Texas, will also require the plugs that Tesla cars use, known as the North American Charging Standard. Ford and General Motors have also announced that they would equip future vehicles with Tesla's ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loren McDonald, the chief executive of EVAdoption, a data and analysis firm that has been tracking each state's progress, said it was concerning that some automakers have not been clear about whether they will provide adapters with the purchase of vehicles. That is in part because it could complicate the ability of some drivers to use the new chargers. But he noted that Tesla has won many of the bids so far, and other station owners will probably make upgrades to adapt to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Senior Biden administration officials said they expected to see a wave of new chargers becoming available in the coming months, and the federal government had taken steps to help states move more quickly, including streamlining environmental permitting processes. Once states completed the planning and design work, they would be in a position to move much faster, they said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gabe Klein, the executive director of the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, pointed to new private investments in charging infrastructure and said he expected the country to reach the administration's goal before 2030.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The private sector investment is staggering,'' Mr. Klein said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, a policy and data research firm, said states have made substantial progress, but much of the work has not been visible to the public.\n",

    "Two of Florida's most prominent real-estate developers are escaping the crowded beaches for a corner of the Rocky Mountains, where they are launching a nearly $1 billion hotel and residential project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fort Partners, which opened four Four Seasons hotels in Florida including the Surf Club, and Merrimac Ventures are building a Four Seasons hotel and condo property in Telluride, Colo., by the foot of the mountain where the ski gondolas begin their ascent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will feature 52 guest rooms, where the owners expect to charge an average rate of more than $1,000 a night. Prices are still being worked out for the 68 residences, but Merrimac said the partners plan to list one-bedrooms starting at more than $2 million. They expect to break ground late next year and open the property two to three years after that. The developers started financing discussions with a number of lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be the first domestic project outside the Sunshine State for either firm. Both say they are far from giving up on South Florida, where they remain active. But the Florida coast has become so overrun with real-estate developers that the partners are traveling thousands of feet above sea level to find a less-congested opportunity, in a niche ski town that hasn't seen a new luxury hotel in more than a decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The idea is to create a Surf Club style property, only a mountain version,\" said Dev Motwani, a co-managing partner with his brother Nitin Motwani of Merrimac.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fort Lauderdale firm is developing the $4 billion Miami Worldcenter, the 27-acre mixed-use development in downtown Miami near the city's Brightline train station. Merrimac developed the Four Seasons in Fort Lauderdale with Nadim Ashi, Fort Partners' chief executive, at the site where the Motwani family used to run a motel geared toward spring breakers in the 1980s and the 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dev Motwani said he has never been much of a skier, but on a trip to New York City he met a businessman from Telluride who convinced the Florida developer that the mountain town was ripe for a new luxury development. After researching the area, he approached Ashi to see if he would be interested in teaming up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that Ashi, a serious skier, had been spending part of his winters for the past 30 years on the slopes at Telluride. \"I told him I was spending time there and his eyes lit up,\" Motwani said.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-end Colorado ski resorts performed well in recent years. Average daily room rates for Vail and Aspen luxury resorts were about $696 over the first 10 months of this year, compared with about $467 for that period in 2019, according to real-estate data and analytic firm CoStar. Revenue per available room for the first 10 months this year stands at nearly $384 -- a 44% increase from the period in 2019, CoStar said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite limited competition for the high-end traveler, opening a luxury property in Telluride isn't without challenges. The town, best known for its annual film festival, is more remote and less crowded than Vail or Aspen. Direct flights remain limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mountain resorts are highly weather-dependent. A lack of snow can squash impromptu trips and even discourage bookings for the next year, said Jan Freitag, CoStar's national director for hospitality analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowfall becomes an even bigger issue as these venues might have to contend with more extreme changes in weather conditions due to climate change, he added.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Colorado resorts have actively tried to make their destinations more year-round. Summer activities such as mountain biking and food and wine festivals expanded the tourism base beyond ski bums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average daily rates for Vail and Aspen in July were about $613, up from about $430 for the month in 2019, a sign that the resorts are now \"able to attract the high-end guests in the summer as well,\" Freitag said, even though those rates are still well below peak ski season levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ashi said he is in discussions with European spa companies to make Telluride a year-round destination for wellness cleansing. The area is drawing summer guests for musical festivals, mountain biking and hiking trails.\n",

    "It's cold as a walk-in refrigerator at the Mongolian Circus School, housed in a once proud edifice now on the verge of collapse with cracked walls, moldy ceilings and the stale smell of decades of cigarette smoke embedded into the venue's wooden frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of teenage acrobats shrug off the frigid, fraying surroundings to practice leaping and somersaulting through the air, kicking up dust as they land, and enduring the bark of a gruff instructor needling them after each imperfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside on an unpaved driveway, a pair of girls in leotards, one 11 and the other 13, tiptoe around puddles of muddy water to practice one of the most difficult and dangerous contortionist poses, the Marinelli bend. They bite a pad of leather attached to the end of a metal stand and use their jaws to help lift up their bodies. They muster enough strength to curl backward until their buttocks rest on the back of their heads and their legs stretch out in front of their faces like a scorpion's tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dexterity and determination of youngsters like these help explain why Mongolia churns out some of the most coveted circus performers in the world for marquee names like Cirque du Soleil and Ringling Brothers. This, despite a lack of government support and a dearth of training facilities. The 83-year-old Mongolian Circus School building is one of the only places where professionals and students can still prepare.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We are wanted all over the world, but we can't even properly train in our own country,'' said Gerelbaatar Yunden, a former acrobat and circus director who estimates there are currently about 1,300 Mongolian performers working in North America and Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story of how Mongolia, a sparsely populated country roughly the size of Alaska, ended up having so much talent and then wound up sending so many overseas has its origins in the country's former state circus.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homegrown circus once needed lots of trained performers. But that hasn't been the case for many years, and so there has been an exodus, driven in part by the sale of that circus to a famed Mongolian sumo wrestler, who conquered Japan's most sacred sport, but failed to live up to his promise to revive Mongolia's cherished tradition.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Mongolian contortionists have practiced the art form for centuries -- mostly for the enjoyment of nobility -- the idea of combining the discipline with music, clowns, animals and acrobats under one roof didn't take root until 1931. That is when a group of Russian circus performers toured Mongolia, then a Soviet satellite state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mongolians were so enthralled by the visiting Russians that they sent students to Moscow to learn how to put together a similar show. Those students came back and established the first Mongolian circus in 1940. They found a home in what is now the crumbling Mongolian Circus School, a squat, round building meant to resemble the country's ubiquitous nomadic tents known as a ger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three decades later, in 1971, Romania, a fellow socialist country, helped Mongolia build a modern circus facility that could seat thousands more people, its blue-domed roof standing out amid Ulaanbaatar's drab Soviet-style cityscape. For a developing country, the new circus was the epitome of entertainment. Generations of Mongolians would visit the state-run show each year, dazzled by the shiny costumes, the orchestra and the death-defying feats.\n",
    "\n",
    "''People loved it because it was modern,'' said Mr. Gerelbaatar, 43, who remembers attending the circus as far back as the 1980s. ''It was different from traditional arts. It was something fresh.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The show fell on hard times after Mongolia started phasing out its state-run economy in the wake of its democratic revolution in 1990. By the next decade, the government could no longer afford to maintain the circus and started looking for buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous Mongolians at the time was a sumo champion named Dagvadorj Dolgorsuren, better known by his Japanese professional name, Asashoryu. A dominant force in sumo for much of the 2000s, Asashoryu was also considered the sport's enfant terrible and was the target of xenophobic treatment in Japan. He raised hackles for breaching sumo's rigid etiquette by cracking a smile after a victory and not yielding to an older wrestler in a bathhouse corridor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asashoryu was idolized in Mongolia, where he was also a major investor in property and mining. In 2007, he bought the circus and vowed to restore the show to its former glory. He said he would allow performers to train at the modern arena free of charge and raise salaries to attract more talent. He called his new production the Asa Circus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dashdendev Nyam, who had been performing abroad as an acrobat and a juggler, rushed back to Mongolia after hearing of the sale. He wanted to see if there were new opportunities at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new owner's promises quickly proved too good to be true. According to Mr. Dashdendev, Asashoryu often wanted performers to work without pay. He strictly limited access to the blue-domed venue for training. And the few performers offered contracts had no guarantee they would be kept beyond a year. The circus, already limping along when Asashoryu bought it, was left with a skeleton crew, performing only a handful of shows every few months.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Everyone started to give up after a few years,'' said Mr. Dashdendev, 38, who eventually found work touring the United States with the Ringling Brothers. ''We were very sad because it felt like our heritage and our culture was being taken away.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Asashoryu and Mongolia's Ministry of Culture did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performers have banded together in recent years to pressure the government to provide more training space, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Asashoryu's arena has largely been used for concerts, not circus productions or training. The venue, which has been undergoing renovation since 2018, is now closed off by temporary fencing, vandalized by graffiti.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation has frustrated performers like Tsatsral Erdenebileg, a contortionist at Cirque du Soleil's ''Zumanity'' in Las Vegas. Without a clean, safe space for youngsters to learn, she fears the country's circus tradition will eventually disappear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mongolian Circus School building ''doesn't have hot water, it doesn't have heat and it doesn't have enough light,'' said Ms. Tsatsral, 36, who holds the Guinness World Record for the longest Marinelli bend. ''It's dangerous for children to be there.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Tsatsral, who has been performing since she was a young girl, said she would have dedicated her career to a state-supported national circus had there been one in Mongolia. Instead, she has had no choice but to perform abroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving Mongolia can be harrowing for young performers, Ms. Tsatsral said, noting that some are taken advantage of by agents seeking lopsided contracts. For her, moving to Las Vegas was difficult given the extreme differences in climate compared with Mongolia. She suffered from a vitamin D deficiency after she arrived because, in trying to avoid the heat, she virtually never went outdoors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A saving grace about life so far from home is the abundance of countrymen and women performing alongside her. There are so many that they call themselves the ''Mongolian contortion mafia,'' Ms. Tsatsral said. On days off, they potluck Mongolian food and share the latest gossip from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We have each other, but I still really miss my home,'' Ms. Tsatsral said. ''My dream is to teach the young Mongolian generation so they can go to Cirque du Soleil, but where am I going to teach?''\n",

    "George Gascón is running for re-election in a very different climate, where concerns about crime have overtaken demands for equity and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three years ago, George Gascón rode a wave of collective outrage following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis to become district attorney of Los Angeles by promising to make the criminal justice system fairer and, most crucially, to rein in the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to win re-election and stay in office, Mr. Gascón will need to tap into a different type of emotion: fear -- in particular a perception that Los Angeles is less safe and that his policies as district attorney have made it so, an argument advanced by many of his challengers but largely unsupported by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think that this race now for 2024 has gone back to, for a lot of people, law and order, lock 'em up,'' Mr. Gascón said in an interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Gascón's victory in 2020 was one of the most consequential electoral outcomes from the movement for social justice and police accountability galvanized by Mr. Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer. And for the national movement that in recent years has helped elect progressive prosecutors in jurisdictions across the country, the victory in Los Angeles was momentous: The county, with a population almost the size of Ohio's has the nation's largest prosecution office, the largest jail system and a long history of police abuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Mr. Gascón, 69, is running for re-election in a very different political climate. Demands for equity and accountability in policing and prosecution have been overtaken by concerns about what to do about crime -- the question that has dominated the district's attorney's race in Los Angeles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 11 candidates challenging Mr. Gascón include judges, attorneys in his own office and former federal prosecutors, nearly all to varying degrees running to the right of Mr. Gascón.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Yes, crime is up,'' John McKinney, a prosecutor in Mr. Gascón's office who is among the challengers, told the crowd at a debate this fall hosted by the Santa Monica Democratic Club. ''That's why you're all here tonight.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The first round of the election is in March, and if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote -- unlikely given the low numbers each candidate is currently polling at -- the top two candidates will face each other in November.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even as Mr. Gascón's opponents paint a picture of out-of-control crime, the data indicates that Los Angeles, like much of the country, is becoming safer in crucial categories of violent crime, such as murder, as the social and economic disruptions of pandemic recede. In the city of Los Angeles, which accounts for about 40 percent of the population of Los Angeles County, most violent crimes are down substantially compared to 2021, Mr. Gascón's first year in office.\n",
    "\n",
    "Murder, often a proxy for people's wider views on crime, is down about 18 percent, while rape is down close to 19 percent. But property crimes, including burglary and car theft, have risen, the only crime tracked by the F.B.I. that has gone up in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in 2020, progressives like Mr. Gascón often tried to use data to persuade voters concerned about crime that their feelings didn't always match reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, he is taking a different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We can talk to people about data, and that doesn't really resonate,'' he said. ''So I gave up on talking about data. I'll throw it in there to sprinkle, but I immediately try to connect with people on a human level. Acknowledging their feelings, because their feelings are real.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Gascón is facing opposition not only from candidates to the right of him, accusing him of making Los Angeles less safe and failing to take a tough stance on crime, but also from liberal-minded voters who are either worried about crime or have become disenchanted by his policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing up in Los Angeles, Mauricio Caamal says he was routinely harassed by the police. He was also a victim of crime when he was 4 years old, and his father was robbed and murdered in downtown L.A.\n",
    "\n",
    "When 2020 came around, and the nation convulsed with protests over the murder of Mr. Floyd, Mr. Caamal was drawn to the streets over a police killing closer to home: A sheriff's deputy in Los Angeles shot Andres Guardado, an 18-year-old security guard, five times in the back, killing him. Mr. Caamal, 32, embraced the calls to defund the police, and supported Mr. Gascón.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Gascón first rose to prominence as an assistant police chief in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s. More than a decade later, after serving as the police chief in San Francisco and then winning two terms as that city's district attorney, he returned to Los Angeles to run for district attorney there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In office, Mr. Gascón has pursued dozens of cases against police officers, a rarity under his predecessor. But earlier this year, after a long investigation, he declined to bring charges against the deputy in Mr. Guardado's case, determining there was ''insufficient evidence'' to support charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think that, on its own, should be enough for me not to vote for him again,'' Mr. Caamal said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Gascón beat back an early effort to recall him from office, which was supported by some prosecutors who work for him, after his opponents failed to secure enough signatures to force a new election. That allowed him to avoid the fate of his counterpart in San Francisco, Chesa Boudin, who was recalled last year amid an acrimonious debate in that city about property crimes and visible squalor in the streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To win another term, Mr. Gascón says he must hone his message to connect reforms with public safety by arguing, for instance, that second chances and more lenient sentences reduce recidivism and improve safety over the long haul.\n",
    "\n",
    "''You cannot really have sustainable public safety if you don't address the inequities in the system,'' he said. He added, ''So it's a much more nuanced campaign in the sense that we have to, even to get to the same place, we have to go through a process of explaining a lot more'' the connection between reform and public safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I feel less safe since he's been there,'' said Karim Bailey, 42, a middle-school teacher in South Los Angeles whose classroom discussions often center on neighborhood crime and policing. He has had his car's catalytic converter stolen twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Bailey said he couldn't recall which candidate he voted for in 2020 but that he would not be supporting Mr. Gascón this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "''A lot of the cases that I've seen that have involved him, it just seems like he puts the interest of the criminal over the interest of the general public,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2020, Maria-Isabel Rutledge knocked on doors for Mr. Gascón's campaign. She is supporting him again this time around, arguing that he needs more time to carry out reforms she believes are necessary to make the system fairer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Rutledge, 70, is a retired teacher's assistant and lives in South Central Los Angeles, the epicenter of the uprising in 1992 after the acquittal of several police officers in the beating of Rodney King.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I know that, if he continues in the same trajectory, that he's going, hopefully, to be able to make change,'' she said of Mr. Gascón. ''It's difficult and challenging to reform the dated institutionally racist system,'' she said. ''The system of racism is very, very embedded in the United States, but we have to keep going in the right direction, we have to keep chipping at it a little bit at a time.''\n",
    "\n",

    "In January, the American Museum of Natural History's new insectarium gained 500,000 tenants. It has taken them some time to find their footing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a cold, gray afternoon in December, and at the American Museum of Natural History, a half million leaf-cutter ants were hunkered down in their homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ants typically spend their days harvesting slivers of leaves, which they use to grow expansive fungal gardens that serve as both food and shelter. On many days, visitors to the museum's insectarium can watch an endless river of ants transporting leaf fragments from the foraging area to the fungus-filled glass orbs where they live.\n",
    "\n",
    "But on Tuesday, the flow of leaf-cutter ants had slowed to a trickle, with just a few intrepid insects visibly living up to their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was hard to blame them. It was a biting, blustery day -- and the end of a long, eventful year for the colony. The tropical ants, which had been harvested in Trinidad and nurtured in Oregon, had never set foot in New York City before last December, arriving like 500,000 insect ingénues. It took time for the ants to find their footing and for museum employees to learn how to create a happy home for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work is not over yet. As winter returns, the museum is making more tweaks to the exhibit, a fitting capstone to a year that has featured a lot of learning through trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We knew that we were going to do a lot of problem solving during the first year,'' said Hazel Davies, the museum's director of living exhibits. ''We've been doing these mini science experiments constantly.''\n",
    "\n",
    "When the ants first moved into the exhibit in January, the curators knew it would take them some time to adjust. But the transition was slower than expected. Ms. Davies and her colleagues spent weeks trying to coax the ants along the labyrinthine path that led from the fungal gardens to the leaf-packed foraging area. During those early weeks, the ants foraged so little that their fungal gardens started shrinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major problem, the team soon realized, was that the air was too cold and dry for the ants, which preferred warm, humid weather. Not only was it winter in New York, but the museum's brand-new insectarium was still under construction, making climate control difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the museum installed a humidifier behind the display case and devised temporary shortcuts to make foraging easier. By the time the insectarium opened in May, the colony was humming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ants thrived during the sticky summer months, harvesting leaves so rapidly that the foraging area required daily restocking. Staff members experimented with a variety of leaves, including maple, azalea and mulberry, which turned out to be a favorite. Sometimes they even treated the ants to what they called ''fast food,'' providing old-fashioned oats, which the ants did not need to cut before harvesting. (''They basically grab a piece of oat and go,'' Ms. Davies said.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the ants rebuilt the fungus they had lost and then some. ''So we have had these wild animals living in the building and really thriving,'' said Jessica Ware, a curator and the division chair of invertebrate zoology at the museum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Davies and her colleagues were proactive as winter approached, adding a water heater to the exhibit and covering the display case with a blanket at night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, on some really cold, dry days, they have found themselves facing familiar climatic challenges. So they have been coaxing some reluctant ants out onto the foraging platform with a trail of leaves, and they recently installed an additional humidifier inside the exhibit. They hope that the new humidifier will be enough to keep the ants active in the months ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, the colony is growing, and the ants have started several fungal gardens in the last few weeks, Ms. Davies said. And even on the coldest days, the insects haven't lost their hustle. Although few ants were actively foraging on Tuesday, they were busy performing chores, including taking out the trash, at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, the last year has been a testament to the ants' resilience. Even during the difficult weeks last spring, Ryan Garrett, a self-described ant wrangler who collected the colony for the museum, never doubted that the ants could make it in New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all, since collecting the colony in 2018, Mr. Garrett has watched it grow from a few hundred ants with a golf-ball-size fungal garden to a 500,000-ant powerhouse with enough fungus to fill a 50-gallon trash can. ''I never lost faith in this colony,'' he said. ''I know what they can do.''\n",

    "\n",
    "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is working to pull together her biggest and most difficult bipartisan deal yet. It also could be her last.\n",
    "\n",
    "The centrist Arizona senator, who aligns with Democrats despite having left the party a year ago, has helped shape major laws related to infrastructure, climate, same-sex marriage and guns. Now she is one of a handful of negotiators working to change U.S. immigration law, which lawmakers of both parties acknowledge is politically fraught, maddeningly complicated -- and newly urgent, because Republicans made it a condition for backing new aid to Ukraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The senator is also closing in on a deadline on whether to run for re-election, this time as an independent. As she has chalked up successes on Capitol Hill, she has also angered many Democrats who helped get her elected five years ago. Arizona is struggling to manage a surge of migrants, further raising the political stakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is definitely the hardest thing we've done,\" Sinema said in an interview, citing the complexity and politicization of border law. She declined to say whether she plans to run again. Asked by a reporter if a successful immigration deal would affect her decision, she responded: \"Dumb question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The 47-year-old lawmaker, who started to put in place campaign infrastructure earlier this year, needs to make a decision by April and collect enough signatures to get on the ballot. She would likely face Ruben Gallego, a Democratic congressman, and Kari Lake, a far-right Republican former local TV anchor, in a difficult three-way race that recent polling indicates she might lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In border talks, Sinema meets regularly with Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the handpicked Republican negotiator and top Republican on a border-management subcommittee she chairs, and Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), chair of the subcommittee that provides appropriations for the Homeland Security Department. She says she has put an emphasis on efficiency in their closed-door discussions, while also giving regular progress updates to reporters, a break with her long-held reluctance to engage with the media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussions have centered on changing rules related to asylum and establishing a new expulsion authority at the border. Democratic and Republican leaders have said the talks remain on track but need more time. They said they hope to hold a vote early next year on a deal that combines border-policy changes with $110.5 billion in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any deal would have to overcome decades of fruitless partisan fighting. Republicans have complained that Democrats started the talks too late and so far have only been willing to take half steps. Some Democrats, particularly progressive and Hispanic lawmakers, are also leery of any deal, worried that the White House and negotiators gave up too much too soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sinema has been involved in immigration issues for years, starting when she was a social worker and continuing in the Arizona legislature and U.S. Senate. Her views have shifted to the right from her time as an outspoken progressive in the state legislature to a moderate in Congress.\n",
    "\n",
    "She organized a visit to the border in January that included both Lankford and Murphy. Since then, according to a Murphy aide, Lankford and Murphy have been trading ideas on changes to asylum policies. Representatives for Lankford and Murphy declined to make the senators available to comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Known for occasionally sporting colorful wigs, Sinema is an unconventional senator, both in her willingness to buck party orthodoxies and in her approach to negotiations, which colleagues privately say can be exasperating but effective. She has identified which staffers are crafting a bill and then begun working directly with them, according to a person familiar with the matter -- even though senators typically work either with each other or through their own staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sinema has been at the center of high-profile negotiations in recent years. Those have included a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure law; President Biden's signature climate, healthcare and tax law; a major semiconductor law; as well as a gun-control measure. She helped enact a law protecting same-sex marriage by winning over Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) with religious-freedom provisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While helping shape bipartisan pacts, she also repeatedly blocked key pieces of Biden's agenda that she saw as ill-conceived. She refused to help Senate Democrats end or weaken filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to advance most legislation. She made Biden scale back his multibillion-dollar Build Back Better agenda. She single-handedly forced the party to scuttle its plans to raise the top marginal rates for corporate, capital-gains and individual-income taxes. Later, she made the party drop plans to increase taxes on a key source of private-equity managers' income.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"She's done it time and time again,\" said Kai Newkirk, an Arizona-based progressive activist. \"Rather than fight for what the voters who elected her want, she's asked: 'What do extremist Republicans want? What do big corporate donors want?' It's why Democrats in Arizona are absolutely done with her.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Cryptocurrency has its detractors, including the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who told a congressional hearing this month that the government should ban digital assets. But few crypto critics have been as committed to trying to understand the technology and to thoroughly exploring the industry -- which has seemed at times to make money from nothing -- as the Bloomberg investigative reporter Zeke Faux. In his book, ''Number Go Up,'' he travels around the world for two years meeting the people fueling the enthusiasm for digital tokens -- and uncovering corruption, greed and exploitation along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book was released about a month before the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the crypto exchange FTX, who was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy last month. Faux begins by admitting that he did not see through Bankman-Fried's billionaire wunderkind facade when they met. But Faux did have his suspicions about the crypto industry and promises from digital asset enthusiasts that blockchain would democratize finance, and he met many of the people peddling these ideas. ''From the beginning, I thought that crypto was pretty dumb. And it turned out to be even dumber than I imagined,'' he writes.\n",

Belloni rose up through the Hollywood trades and is the author of Puck's flagship newsletter, What I'm Hearing, but on the podcast he adopts an approach that welcomes in more casual followers of media news. Close watchers of the industry, however, will still appreciate the interviews with newsmakers like Ted Sarandos, a Netflix chief executive, and Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, on hot topics like the streaming wars, the actors' and writers' strikes and why superhero movies are stumbling.\n",

In ''Fire Weather,'' the reporter John Vaillant writes about an earlier wildfire that provided a hint of what was to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was engulfed in flames, forcing 90,000 people to evacuate. The city is the center of Canada's oil sands industry, which means it relies on the production of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Vaillant calls it a ''bifurcated reality,'' with executives acknowledging the threat posed by carbon dioxide emissions but still making money from the industry despite the damage it evidently causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contradictions won't end soon. Some of the world's biggest energy companies signaled this year that they are doubling down on fossil fuels via a series of deals in the shale oil patch. July was the hottest month ever recorded. And the United Nations' climate conference in United Arab Emirates -- a petrostate -- was the first to publicly state that the world needs to move away from fossil fuels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aren't done producing and using fossil fuels, and our world is heating up. Those two trends are inevitably going to bang into each other again, and Vaillant's book is a useful look at how that might unfold.\n",

    "\n",
    "In ''The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism,'' he argues that's changing because the system is failing to deliver economically and politically, leading to the rise of populists and self-defeating political movements. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump as president and the rise of rentier capitalism are all bad for democratic societies and the institutions upon which they rely, he writes. And that has worrying consequences for free societies and the businesses that operate within them.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Against the odds, facing the encroaching Sahara, he built a forest in Burkina Faso, becoming ''a national hero'' and winning acclaim abroad for his innovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yacouba Sawadogo, a farmer known as ''the man who beat the desert'' in Burkina Faso for revolutionizing agricultural methods and creating a 75-acre forest on barren land, died on Dec. 3 in Ouahigouya, a northern provincial capital in that West African country. He was 77.\n",
    "\n",
    "His death, in a hospital after a long illness, was confirmed by his son Loukmane Sawadogo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Sawadogo, a lean, taciturn man who never learned to read or write, received a hero's welcome when he returned home to landlocked Burkina Faso in 2018 after winning the Right Livelihood Award in Stockholm, created in 1980 to honor social and environmental activists. A throng greeted him at the airport in Ouagadougou, the country's capital, and he was received by the country's president.\n",
    "\n",
    "Years before, fellow villagers in his arid, windswept country in the north had called him a madman for implementing a simple improvement to an age-old water-conservation technique. But Mr. Sawadogo had the last laugh: Forestry experts said the forest he created, with more than 60 species of trees and shrubs, had no equal in the Sahel, the semidesert region stretching across Africa's upper third.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sahara's encroachment, abetted by decades of indiscriminate tree-cutting and now by climate change, with decreased rainfall, is a major threat to an already fragile region. Large swaths of land have been stripped of trees, from the Gulf of Guinea right up to the desert.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of his life, Mr. Sawadogo was recognized as one of the few who had successfully pushed back. Farmers using his techniques have more than tripled their grain yields, in an area where agriculture must depend on sparse rain. Burkina Faso, the world's 22nd-poorest country, has an average life expectancy of under 63.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chris Reij, a Dutch geographer and a senior fellow of the World Resources Institute in Washington, said in a phone interview that Mr. Sawadogo ''single-handedly has had more impact on soil and water conservation than all the experts combined.'' He added: ''He managed to build a forest out of nothing, a forest of 30 hectares with the largest biodiversity in the Sahel. At the end, he became a sort of national hero.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Sawadogo won the United Nations Champions of the Earth award in 2020. Luc Gnacadja, a former head of the U.N.'s anti-desertification program, said in an interview from bordering Benin: ''He was exceptional. A whole zone that had been desertified was transformed.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Gnacadja invited Mr. Sawadogo to be the keynote speaker for a high-level conference in Switzerland. ''He explained, in all humility, what he had done,'' he said, ''and he left us a legacy that shows that degradation of ecosystems is not inevitable.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Sawadogo had an almost mystical relationship to the trees he brought into being -- the marula, the acacia, the gum arabic, the desert date tree -- treating them ''like humans,'' his cousin Arouna Sawadogo said in an interview from Burkina Faso. When arsonists, jealous of Mr. Sawadogo's success, torched his forest several times in the 2000s, Arouna Sawadogo said, he was ''an old man with a sad face; he stayed in the ashes for several days.''\n",
    "\n",
    "But he always bounced back, telling his son Loukmane, one of his 27 children by three wives, ''Even if I have a little bit of force left, even for one minute, if there is a tree to plant, I will do it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "It took years of hardship -- drought, famine and shifting political winds in a country where strongmen rulers alternate through coups d'état -- for Mr. Sawadogo to effect his transformation from suspect outsider to figure of respect, sought after by farmers throughout the Sahel for his counsel.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Some people just do whatever they want with our forests,'' Mr. Sawadogo said in a 2010 film about him, ''The Man Who Stopped the Desert,'' by the British producer and director Mark Dodd. ''When you are serious and start work that others don't appreciate, then they treat you as a madman.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He recalled: ''People wouldn't even speak to me. They said I was a crazy man.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Sawadogo's heresy revolved around transforming the practice of what local farmers called zai -- digging small pits to capture precious rainwater. These farmers typically waited until the start of the rainy season, at the beginning of summer, to dig the zai.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Mr. Sawadogo began well before, when the earth was bone-dry. And he dug the pits wider and deeper. He put manure and rocks in the bottom of them. He made use of termites to help break up the land. The manure contained seeds. When the rain came, the rocks helped retain the water, and the water turned the seeds into seedlings, which he nurtured. The soil would stay moist for several weeks after the rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The results were striking; the soil improved along with his crop yield,'' the U.N. said in announcing his award. ''He was able to grow trees in the arid ground.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Sawadogo eventually helped the process along, planting trees himself. Trees protected crops from the wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "''As soon as I understood how important trees were, I set to work on planting the forest,'' he said in the film. Mr. Reij of the World Resources Institute said, ''For him the trees became more important than the grains.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Yacouba Sawadogo was born on Jan. 1, 1946, in Gourga, a village about 110 miles north of Ouagadougou, to Adama Sawadogo, a farmer, and Fatimata Bilem. When he was very young his parents sent him to a Quranic school in Mali, where, he recalled in the film, the leader of the school told him he was destined for great things.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he returned home as a teenager, he opened a stall selling motorcycle parts in the market in Ouahigouya, the provincial capital. It was successful, enabling him to put aside money. But, he later told interviewers, he was restless and yearned to return to the land. Stacking the odds against him was the looming drought that devastated the Sahel from the mid-1970s, when he left the market, to the mid-1980s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainfall decreased by 30 percent. Whole villages were abandoned because farmers were no longer able to feed their families. ''It was a bit of an environmental disaster,'' Mr. Reij said. It became urgent to conserve what little rainfall there was, and to use it productively. Mr. Sawadogo began experimenting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved zai -- he put millet seeds in the pits as well -- led to a tripling of his grain yield, allowing him to feed his family for three years, he told one interviewer in 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 1990s, researchers as well as farmers were coming to study his methods; Niger alone sent 13 farmers. Fame for Mr. Sawadogo and trips abroad followed. He participated in a United Nations conference on climate change and testified before congressional staffers in Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "''He was a bit like the trees he wanted to protect, simple and accessible,'' Luc Damiba, a honey producer and film festival director in Burkina Faso, said in an interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the last fire, at the urging of Burkina citizens, the government built a fence around Mr. Sawadogo's forest, Mr. Reij said.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to his son Loukmane, Mr. Sawadogo's survivors include his three wives, Safiata, Khaddar Su and Raqueta, and his 26 other children.\n",
    "\n",
    "''He managed to find resources to stand up to drought,'' Mr. Gnacadja said. ''That's called adaptation.''\n",

    "She is best remembered for importing reindeer to the Scottish Highlands centuries after they were hunted to extinction. About 150 roam there today.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article is part of Overlooked , a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1952, the anthropologist Ethel Lindgren made a decision that would change the face of the Scottish Highlands for decades to come: She imported a herd of reindeer. Reindeer, while native to Britain, had not been seen there since the 12th century, when they were hunted to extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindgren made the case to government officials that the animals were important sources of meat and fur. And with the looming threat of a conflict with the Soviet Union, she said, the reindeer could be useful in military transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "But her motivations were also romantic: It would be, she wrote in a letter, a chance ''to see against the Scottish skyline a very beautiful animal.''\n",
    "\n",
    "She started by importing seven reindeer -- two bulls and five cows -- on a Swedish ship, the Sarek. They were quarantined for nearly a month at Edinburgh Zoo before being released in the Cairngorms, a mountain range in the Highlands, where their progress was monitored. The climate was favorable; in fact, the unique subarctic qualities of the Cairngorms make it the only place left in Britain that could support the animals. More reindeer were imported in the years that followed; their progeny still roam the Highlands today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindgren is best remembered for her reindeer experiment, but she made many contributions to the field of anthropology in a long career that has largely been lost to history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethel John Lindgren was born on Jan. 1, 1905, in Evanston, Ill., to an American mother and a Swedish American father. She was 11 when her father, John R. Lindgren, the founder of the State Bank of Chicago, died. He gave most of his fortune to charitable institutions but left his daughter an annuity to provide for her education and, eventually, her fieldwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a young girl, Ethel would watch trains whistle past her hometown and dream of traveling east. The opportunity came after her mother, Ethel Roe Lindgren, a pianist, married Henry Eichhorn, an ethnomusicologist and composer known for incorporating instruments he collected on his visits to China and Japan. At 17, the younger Ethel took a year off from her schooling at Miss Lee's School in Boston and traveled east with her mother and stepfather.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Great Wall in Kalgan, China (now Zhangjiakou), overlooking Mongolia, she gazed over the expanse of ''dun-coloured land continuing to the horizon'' and was awed by ''a great feeling of serenity, of eternity,'' she wrote in her diary. The experience impressed on her a fixed objective: One day, she would return.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unprecedented number of women entered anthropology during the period between the world wars. While some argued that fieldwork was too dangerous for women, the anthropologist Lyn Schumaker wrote in a chapter of ''A New History of Anthropology'' (2008), edited by Henrika Kuklick, that they were thought to possess many of the qualities -- ''sympathy, tact, adaptability'' -- essential for fruitful fieldwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was around this time that Lindgren entered Newnham College, University of Cambridge, where she studied Chinese and social science. She then earned a research fellowship and a Ph.D., also from Cambridge. Five years of fieldwork in Manchuria formed the basis of her thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its subject was shamanism among the Reindeer Tungus, a collective of reindeer-herding peoples Indigenous to sub-Arctic Asia and better known today as the Evenki. A towering 6 feet 2 inches tall, with cropped red hair and a fearsome self-confidence, Lindgren cut a formidable figure alongside the Evenki, who called her ''mangus,'' or ''giant.''\n",
    "\n",
    "She brought along the man who would become her first husband, Oscar Mamen, a Norwegian adventurer and salesman working in Mongolia. He offered protection and technical aid by carrying her cameras and taking photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together they produced an enormous, and enormously valuable, trove of over 8,000 photographs and 300 films. These are among the only existing photographic records of the traditional Solon and Manchu cultures, before life changed with the takeover of Chinese Communism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindgren was 24 in 1929 when she and other expatriates were ousted from Manchuria by the looming Soviet threat. She was crushed. She wrote to a friend: ''Behind and above and beyond I see only the barren hills and, at night, the stars against a metallic disk of sky outlined by the round hole in the top of the felt yurt -- and in my soul are tears.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in England, Lindgren and Mamen married and had a son, John. But they soon divorced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1938, she became the first woman to be appointed editor in chief of The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, a pre-eminent publication in the discipline. By the time she stepped down in 1948, her 11-year tenure had supported the publication through wartime shortages and cost-saving measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindgren's scholarly interests included the methodologies of fieldwork, social psychology, shamanism, human-animal relations and material culture. She believed fieldworkers' psychological profiles could impact their interpretation of data and urged researchers to undergo psychological training to target their biases, long before such reflexivity was commonplace in the social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1949, she took up a lectureship in the department of anthropology and archaeology at Cambridge, but she was terminated two years later because the topics she covered -- her focus was on Central Asia and Northern Europe -- were deemed less valuable to colonial cadets than learning about East Africa, India and the Middle East. She never returned to academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindgren was naturalized in 1940. She channeled her aptitude as a social scientist toward tireless war service -- first at the Ministry of Information, then as liaison officer for the Royal Institute of International Affairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peace, Lindgren wrote in a letter, could be achieved through a ''blending of cultures.'' The easy coexistence of Cossacks, a Slavic people, and Evenki was ready evidence that ''the interchange of cultural traits is a very important background for intergroup friendships.''\n",
    "\n",
    "She had occasion to test this hypothesis in 1939, when the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the United States asked her to report on the feasibility of the Alaska resettlement project, a largely forgotten attempt under the Roosevelt administration's New Deal to relocate Jewish refugees to Alaska, where federal immigration quotas did not apply. Her interviews with locals revealed that far-reaching antisemitism had not spared Alaska. For this and other reasons, the plan never materialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1947, Lindgren was married a second time, to Mikel Utsi; it was a lasting love in middle age that allowed for her most important legacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "She met Utsi, a reindeer breeder, while in Swedish Lapland to study the Sami, another Indigenous reindeer-herding people.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a scenic train ride with Lindgren and her son, Utsi first set eyes on the rolling landscape of the Cairngorms and noticed its similarities to his homeland. He exclaimed, ''There must be reindeer moss here!,'' referring to the popular pasture among the animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today there are 150 reindeer who roam freely over 10,000 acres in the Highlands. They are observed by the Cairngorm Reindeer Company, an educational center that Lindgren and Utsi founded. The herd celebrated its 70th anniversary last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindgren and Utsi lived between the Cairngorms and Cambridge, where she was a founding fellow of Lucy Cavendish College, established at the University of Cambridge in 1965. They remained together until Utsi died in 1979.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindgren was the secretary of the Reindeer Council of the United Kingdom and the Reindeer Company until her death, on March 23, 1988. She was 83. Since then, the herd has been managed by Tilly Smith, the only female herder in Britain, and her husband, Alan.\n",

    "These shows, including ''The Grift'' and ''The Perfect Scam,'' will deepen your understanding of how liars and con artists operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The past decade has seen an alarming surge in scams across the world, as digital life has created a whole new playbook for criminals to prey on the vulnerable. Combined with a political and cultural climate in which lies, disinformation and outright fraud seem to run rampant (just consider high-profile examples like Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried), it's easy to feel surrounded by grifters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encompassing many kinds of elaborate deception, like art forgery, romance scams and medical fraud, these six shows focus not just on the perpetrators (and how to spot them), but on the life-altering devastation they can leave in their wake. While these podcasts won't leave you feeling reassured on that front, they'll deepen your understanding of how liars and con artists operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Believe In Magic'\n",
    "\n",
    "On its surface, the scheme at the center of this BBC investigative podcast sounds almost too cartoonishly evil to be real: a mother-daughter duo committing fraud while running a charity that billed itself as a ''fairy godmother'' to terminally ill children. But that's just a small part of a story that's much more nuanced and disturbing. Back in 2012, Megan Bhari, then 16, and her charity Believe In Magic rose to prominence in Britain after being spotlighted by members of the chart-topping boy band One Direction. So when Megan fell seriously ill herself with a rare form of brain cancer, well-wishers flocked to donate money to her crowdfunding campaign for experimental treatments -- until a few followers began to notice holes in her story. As the show gradually focuses in on Megan's dynamic with her co-founder and seemingly doting mother, Jean, the host Jamie Bartlett unravels this twist-filled and ultimately tragic saga with skill and sensitivity.\n",

    "'The Perfect Scam'\n",
    "\n",
    "Older Americans are among the most likely to fall victim to a variety of con jobs, and may be especially vulnerable to ones that prey on loneliness like romance hustles, grandparent swindles and even pet scams. In light of this, the AARP debuted a podcast in 2019 to boost awareness of common (and some less common) red flags. Several episodes dive into a specific and particularly wild story, like the Colorado funeral home whose operator was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing body parts and selling them for hundreds of thousands of dollars without family members' consent. Others focus on a category -- including Zelle fraud, fake Covid tests and computer lockouts -- featuring first-person accounts from victims and information on how listeners can avoid such traps.\n",

    "\n",
    "'Unravel: Snowball'\n",
    "\n",
    "A true-crime anthology series from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ''Unravel'' chronicled an unforgettable scam story in its fourth season. Ollie Wards, a radio producer in New Zealand, is both host and subject, recounting how his family lost everything after becoming entangled with an alluring California ''entrepreneur'' named Lezlie Manukian. Ward recalls feeling uneasy on the day of his brother's wedding to Manukian without quite knowing why -- but within months, she had vanished along with their parents' life savings, leaving behind only a mysterious warning: ''The snowball's about to hit you.'' It's strange details like this, along with Ward's personal stake in the mystery, that make these seven episodes so gripping.\n",

    "\n",
    "'Chameleon: Scam Likely'\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in its sixth season, the Campside Media podcast ''Chameleon'' has explored stories about impostors and charlatans of various stripes, including the ''Hollywood Con Queen'' who wreaked havoc in the film industry, and a so-called doctor who hypnotized victims into giving up their fortunes. The 'Scam Likely' season is a little different, focusing not on one particular con artist but on a group of people dedicated to stopping them. The investigative journalist Yudhijit Bhattacharjee, who originally reported out the story for The New York Times Magazine, shadows a small team of government investigators who are tasked with tracking down the perpetrators of one of the largest tele-fraud scams in American history, in which tens of thousands of ordinary Americans lost a combined total of more than $300 million. ''Scam Likely'' has a thrilling on-the-ground feel, with Bhattacharjee interviewing victims and investigators before ultimately traveling to India to hunt down the culprits on their home turf.\n",

    "\n",
    "'The Grift'\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it ran for just one season back in 2017, this Panoply series is well worth the listen, delivering detailed portraits of 10 highly successful grifters. Maria Konnikova, a journalist and author who wrote about the psychology of deceit in her 2016 book ''The Confidence Game,'' sets out to understand why so many of us still fall for fraudulent schemes despite being convinced that we'd never be so naïve. In each episode, Konnikova profiles a different fraud (the lineup includes an art forger, a card shark and a psychic) and allows them to tell their own stories, laying out the architecture and power dynamics of their cons with a level of detail that's both unsettling and oddly mesmerizing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare and once little-known psychological condition with potentially devastating consequences, has gathered mainstream coverage in recent years because of high-profile cases like that of Gypsy Rose Blanchard. In a typical case, a parent or caregiver will either feign or deliberately cause an illness in their child, often subjecting the child to unnecessary medical tests and procedures and inflicting psychological trauma. ''Nobody Should Believe Me'' is a rich and harrowing chronicle of the condition, hosted by a novelist, Andrea Dunlop, whose own family was deeply impacted by allegations of medical child abuse. More than a decade later, she interviews doctors, law enforcement officials and victims to finally understand the condition that devastated her family, homing in on the recent case of Hope Ybarra, a Texas mother who spent 10 years in prison for the medical abuse she inflicted on her daughter.\n",

    "Prime Rib, a Culinary Luxury of the Past, Is Still What's for Holiday Dinner\n",

    "\n",
    "On a biting December evening, the St. Clair Supper Club in Chicago's West Loop neighborhood offered an escape out of the weather -- and into America's culinary past.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dimly lit basement dining room, wood paneling covered the walls, and paper place mats cheerily proclaimed, ''We're glad you're here!'' A cushioned leather strip ran around the lip of the long bar, inviting guests to lean in for a while. Over the speakers, Frank Sinatra's ''My Way'' gave way to Gordon Lightfoot crooning ''The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipe: Prime Rib\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoying the ambience were young couples on dinner dates and groups of friends gathering for holiday martinis. And on nearly every table, wading in pools of redolent jus, were great rosy slabs of prime rib -- the charismatic megaprotein that for so many decades defined a sense of middle-class American plenty.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the year, despite all appearances, was 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "The St. Clair Supper Club simulates a dining experience that once was widespread, one that still can be found in any number of towns in Wisconsin, Illinois or Pennsylvania. But it is run by Grant Achatz, one of the most inventive chefs in the United States. He has created a sort of prime-rib museum, honoring not just the lavish cuts of beef on the plate but what they symbolize: a lost dining culture of accessible, midcentury abundance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion is particularly powerful at Christmastime, when consumers buy 70 percent of all prime rib sold in the United States in a given year, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. The stockpiling and flash-freezing of these cuts starts back in May. All summer, as grocery stores are selling mostly burgers for the backyard grill, the beef industry is already thinking about the biggest-ticket sale of the year: December's standing roast.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We see on holidays and special occasions the times when the kind of longer traditions and deeper histories of how we relate to food come out in ritual,'' said Joshua Specht, the author of ''Red Meat Republic'' and an associate professor of history at the University of Notre Dame.\n",
    "\n",
    "''What time of year is it more important to represent that things are going well than Christmas?'' he added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The St. Clair patrons aren't the only ones indulging in a little nostalgia. Even as steak prices have climbed to an all-time high -- and as serious climate and health concerns around beef have arisen -- the demand for prime rib has grown over the past 20 years. At Christmas in particular, the magnetism of a rib roast is real, with about 33 million pounds sold during last year's holiday season.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be a dish from the American past, but it is a past that many Americans are eager to revisit.\n",
    "\n",
    "'A Symbol of Man's Desire'\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of prime rib exploded in the United States after World War II. The United States was the world's dominant superpower, the economic future looked bright, and beef -- which had been rationed for years -- was back on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amy Bentley, a professor of food studies at New York University and the author of ''Eating for Victory,'' called the cut ''a powerful symbol of abundance.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''That big roast in the middle with the side dishes was a symbol of a meal that was fit for Americans,'' she said. '''Freedom From Want' was Norman Rockwell's way of describing it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A print ad from the American Meat Institute in the mid-1940s connected those ideas quite literally. Under a photo of a raw standing rib roast on a crimson background, the text read, ''This is not just a piece of meat ... This is a symbol of man's desire, his will to survive.'' Published in Life magazine, the mass-market bible of white, middle-class America, the campaign was seen by millions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gendered nature of that early pitch language found its way onto the menus of the prime-rib restaurants that proliferated in the 1950s and 1960s -- places where you could get ''Paul Bunyan's Cut'' or the ''King Henry VIII Cut,'' or, for less hungry diners, the ''Queen Cut'' or ''Ladies Slice.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawry's the Prime Rib, which still offers the ''Diamond Jim Brady Cut,'' was among the first of these restaurants, opening its original Los Angeles location in 1938. House of Prime Rib in San Francisco, followed in 1949; the Prime Rib in Portland, Ore., opened in 1954; and the Prime Rib (no relation) in Baltimore opened in 1965.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime rib didn't just meet you where you lived; it also welcomed you on vacation, especially in Las Vegas. A loss leader and a billboard food for nearly every casino on the Strip, prime rib became the perfect dish for a town branding itself as the vacationland of middle-class luxury.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even well into the 1990s, a prime-rib dinner at some Las Vegas restaurants would still cost less than $10. Until just a few years ago, Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop, which opened in 1954 at the Nugget Casino, served prime rib 24 hours a day. It's not available at 4 a.m. anymore, but an eight-ounce portion can still be had at a more reasonable hour for just $19.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course there were the innumerable blue-collar restaurants, particularly in the upper Midwest, of the sort St. Clair conjures.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think those places were a bit like -- and I don't mean this in a bad way -- a bowling alley,'' said Nick Kokonas, an owner of the Alinea restaurant group, which runs St. Clair. ''People would go bowling in the community, and it wasn't so much about the game as it was seeing all your neighbors and drinking the beers and having conversations and mindless fun -- and in a good way.''\n",
    "\n",
    "If St. Clair evokes the bowling alley of midcentury prime-rib nation, the Grill, at the Seagram Building, is its high temple of Manhattan modernism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally opened in 1959 as the Four Seasons, and resurrected by Major Food Group under the new name in 2017, the space was designed by Philip Johnson with soaring ceilings and creamy French-walnut paneling. At various moments in the 1960s, you could find a Jackson Pollock hanging on the wall and Jackie Kennedy tucking in for lunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Mario Carbone, a co-owner of Major Food Group, prime rib felt intrinsic to the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better sort of culinary representation of that period than this dish,'' Mr. Carbone said. ''Which made it obvious for us to serve it -- the pomp and circumstance.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of that pomp, aside from the $95 price tag, is a trolley custom-built in Brooklyn, which is wheeled up to the table by one of the Grill's two dedicated carvers, who then slices portions to order.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's moves like that, and pieces in a dining room like that, that help us really tell the story to the guests,'' Mr. Carbone said.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Breakup with Beef\n",
    "\n",
    "The story being referenced in that prime rib at the Grill, though, is a story of American economic optimism and surety. And in the early 1970s, that story began to shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of beef was so high by then that boycotts and protests were organized against grocery stores. In the opening sequence of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' Mary Richards famously rolled her eyes at the label of a meat package before tossing it into her cart. By 1973, Curtis Mayfield sang in ''Future Shock'' about ''the price of the meat / Higher than the dope in the street,'' and President Richard M. Nixon had announced government-imposed price ceilings on beef.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years later, in 1976, per capita beef consumption in the United States peaked at about 90 pounds a year, and it has been going down ever since. Today, that figure is about 60 pounds per person a year, according to the U.S.D.A., though in the Midwest, the region that consumes the most beef in the country, that figure is higher historically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many factors are likely to have contributed to the decline: increased awareness of health risks, the rise of environmental concerns about raising cattle and the changing demographics of the American eating public. But it also coincides with the diminishing of the middle class in many American places where prime rib holds the most sway.\n",
    "\n",
    "''That is a time when there's a breakdown of a certain kind of manhood and a certain kind of economic man,'' Prof. Specht said. ''There's a phase change in the economy, and that coincides with a change in the place of the male breadwinner. To be a successful man is to eat steak. And that breaks down in the '70s.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual effects of that notion may still be evident today. A recent study published in the journal Nutrients showed that half of all the beef consumed in the United States on a given day is eaten by just 12 percent of the population. And members of that 12 percent were most likely to be white men between the ages of 50 and 65.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the chef Angie Mar, though, that formulation never made sense. The granddaughter of Chinese immigrants, she grew up in Seattle, eating prime rib not only on Christmas but every Sunday for family dinner. ''There's something that's really wonderful about seeing it carved,'' she said. She now serves prime rib every Thursday at her Manhattan restaurant Le B.\n",
    "\n",
    "''For food to have a gender association to it, I find to be so ridiculously American,'' she said. ''Great food is great food. And it brings all people to the table.''\n",
    "\n",
    "'Nobody Asks About Price'\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the price of beef, the early '70s have nothing on today. A grocery advertisement in The New York Times on Dec. 20, 1973, offered U.S.D.A. choice rib roast at $1.29 per pound. In 2023 dollars, that's $8.59 a pound. In many places around the country today, it is hard to find a prime rib for twice that price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas Dobbels is not especially worried, even though he is in the beef business. For 18 years, he has owned Sages Meat Market in Oswego, Ill., a far west suburb of Chicago about 50 miles from the St. Clair.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Nobody asks about price,'' said Mr. Dobbels, who grew up on a farm in western Illinois before getting a Ph.D. in meat science from Kansas State University. ''They're just like, I want the good stuff. I think people save up for the holidays.''\n",
    "\n",
    "At least one customer this year ordered an entire rack of rib roast, about a 20-pound cut, which at Sages's current price of $31.99 a pound for U.S.D.A. prime grade pencils out to more than $600.\n",
    "\n",

    "Surging inequality has benefi ted wealthy Americans above all. But increasingly, the global economy's biggest winners are elsewhere.\n",

    "In 1974, the libertarian political philosopher Robert Nozick famously defended inequality by offering a thought experiment involving Wilt Chamberlain. Imagine you lived in a society, he proposed, where the distribution of wealth had been orchestrated to be just -- perhaps even egalitarian. But then imagine that a seven-foot celebrity superstar athlete arrived, and the citizens of that society were given the opportunity to pay to watch him. Who could argue he shouldn't get rich? This was, for Nozick, an illustration of his more general ''entitlement theory,'' with Chamberlain an undeniable example of exceptional merit's deserving, by rights, exceptional rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous year, Chamberlain's salary was a quarter of a million dollars, about 20 times the median household income. Today a basketball player earning 20 times the median wouldn't be making much more than the N.B.A.'s minimum salary for rookies of $1.1 million. Those who play even a few minutes a game are typically -- compared with Americans earning average paychecks -- several times richer than Chamberlain ever was. Superstars are many times richer still. The most high-profile new contract this season was signed by Jaylen Brown of the Celtics, and it pays more than $60 million per year, about 800 times the median U.S. salary. Compared with the gap between the American median and Chamberlain's exceptional rewards, that is a fortyfold increase. And Brown is hardly a household name like Wilt, or for that matter Steph or LeBron. This year, he may be only the fifth-best player on his team. As Boston fans know all too well, he can't even really dribble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Athletes, like entertainers, have always been complicated case studies in American oligarchy. They are both entrepreneurs and labor, wealthy and yet often exploited, and have operated for 50 years in an endless boom cycle for the business of sports. But as avatars of the superstar-economy era, athletes -- like the entertainers Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, whose tours this year have apparently had a notable effect on national G.D.P. -- play an outsize role in illustrating the country's inescapable economic morality tale: that while an awful lot has changed about America and the world since 1974, it sometimes seems that the biggest and most important change is the social fact of exploding income inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the country was given a crash course, first by the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, then by Thomas Piketty and his book ''Capital in the 21st Century.'' We learned about the Gini coefficient, which measures the relative inequality of a society, and we learned that, in recent decades, it had grown considerably. We learned that the ratio of chief-executive pay to worker pay grew to 200-to-1 today from 60-to-1 in 1989 from 20-to-1 in 1965. And we watched the rise of Bernie Sanders and the presidency of Donald Trump -- who in accepting the Republican nomination directed his gaze at those left behind by financialization and globalization and announced, ''I am your voice'' -- and interpreted them alongside Brexit and Boris Johnson and Jair Bolsonaro as facets of a hodgepodge international backlash to the neoliberal era and the inequalities it produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Culturally, the age of inequality is still churning: Over just the last six months, we've had ''Rich Men North of Richmond'' and Shawn Fain's leading the United Auto Workers into a triumphant labor war with Detroit's Big Three while wearing an ''Eat the Rich'' T-shirt. But at the structural level, our picture of American inequality also seems to be changing. According to some measures, U.S. income inequality hasn't meaningfully grown over the last decade, the very period in which it has become such a potent cultural and political meme. And in the last few weeks, several high-profile critiques of Piketty's narrative-setting work have been published, both in academic journals and in outlets like Bloomberg and The Financial Times -- with mostly right-of-center commentators suggesting that the story of ballooning inequality, and of our return to the robber barons of the Gilded Age, was all methodological illusion and that inequality hadn't actually been growing at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Piketty compares this to climate denial, and almost certainly the critique is oversold -- it's not just Piketty and his colleagues who have documented significant increases in inequality since 1980 but also the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve. You can quibble about which data set to use and exactly how to measure things, the Serbian American economist Branko Milanovic says, and you get somewhat different estimates for the size of the effect. ''But I think if you take 1980 and take 2006, I think there is no doubt that -- throughout the '80s and '90s and early 2000s -- inequality just went up.''\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the leading scholars of global inequality, Milanovic is best known for his ''elephant chart,'' which measures relative gains along the world's income spectrum. The chart shows that in recent decades, the world's poor saw their incomes grow significantly, as did the world's very rich, with those in between -- the global upper middle class, made up of the working and middle classes of places like the United States and Europe -- stagnating.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are shortcomings to the elephant chart: In documenting only percentage improvement in annual incomes, it equates much smaller absolute gains among the world's poor with much larger absolute gains by the world's rich. But Milanovic believes that in focusing so obsessively on growing divides within countries, we are missing what he calls a great convergence, in which income inequality is in fact declining, and quite rapidly. The global 1 percent is still going strong, he says, but at lower rungs on the income ladder, economic status is undergoing a great rearrangement, with profound implications for the way almost everyone on the planet will live -- and feel -- in the decades to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Poor Westerners for decades have ranked among the highest-earning people in the world,'' Milanovic wrote this summer in Foreign Affairs. ''That will no longer be the case as non-Westerners with rising incomes will displace poor and middle-class Westerners from their lofty perches.'' As a result, a whole suite of privileges once enjoyed by working people in the richer parts of the world may soon pass out of their reach: international travel, for instance, both to exotic vacation destinations and to things like the World Cup, or the newest and most advanced electronics, like smartphones. Already, status markers like spots in prestigious Western universities are increasingly the site of fierce international competition. Housing markets in many global capitals have been squeezed by foreign buyers, as well. ''Drill down to the level of a single person,'' he writes, ''and what becomes apparent is probably the greatest reshuffling of individual positions on the global income ladder since the Industrial Revolution.''\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point, it has been China doing most of the reshuffling. Between 1988 and 2018, a working-class Italian, for instance, has seen his income fall by 17 percentiles in global terms. Over the same period, a Chinese urbanite earning a median local income would have seen his rise by roughly 20 percentiles -- to the 70th from the 50th.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very top of the global pecking order, the makeup of the world's wealthiest has remained relatively secure, in part because few wealthy Chinese have penetrated the top 5 percent of incomes, 80 percent of which are still earned by Westerners. ''And it's useful to think of the top 5 percent as essentially American,'' Milanovic says, ''because 40 percent of the people in the top 5 percent globally are us -- the global rich are actually us.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon enough, that will change radically: Even though Chinese growth rates have slowed, if they nevertheless remain several percentage points above America's, the Chinese share of the world's richest is likely to pass America's by 2050 or perhaps even 2040 -- meaning that, within 70 years of Mao's death, a once-impoverished country would boast more of the planet's wealthy than the ''world's richest country.'' Probably, we're going to have to retire that phrase and stop pretending it means the world is our playground -- at least, ours alone.\n",

    "Readers responded at nytimes.com to Claire Fahy's article last Sunday about the Windham Mountain Club, a ski resort in the Catskills that is rebranding and limiting public access. Comments have been edited.\n",
    "\n",
    "These owners will need to charge far more if they plan to continually replace melting snow with man-made throughout the increasingly rainy winters. Due to climate change, Windham is too far south and too close to the Atlantic Ocean. How many ski days will even be available in a warm winter? None of this makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geo, USA\n",
    "\n",
    "As I sit here not far south or at much lower elevation than this resort, watching rain sheeting down, changes at a ski area in the Catskills strike me as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Even if I were inclined to drop $200,000 to join a ski club, climate change has made this a pretty ill-suited place to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whoops, Earth\n",
    "\n",
    "Responding to Whoops: I bristle at the idea that it's somehow ''unwise'' to buy a ski club membership because of climate change. Maybe people just want to live their dream for a few years and see what happens. I can understand that, even as a nonskier who aspires to less fossil fuel use.\n",

    "As someone who graduated from Windham's high school in the last 10 years, it's terrible how much gentrification is wreaking havoc in small upstate towns like Windham, Hunter, Hudson, Catskill, etc. Gone are the days of community and feeling like everyone in these towns knows one another. Restaurants now are charging New York City-level prices in areas that, generally speaking, are very working class.\n",
    "\n",
    "T, New York\n",
    "\n",
    "My family really loves how nice and new and clean everything looks right now. We go up to the Catskills almost every weekend. For us, gentrification is a good thing. Limiting membership is a good thing. Encouraging buying season tickets is a good thing. This is a win-win and it's something the town should have done a long time ago.\n",

    "I actually really enjoy a bunch of grubbier mountains in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts where you can bring your own chili and zap it in a gross communal microwave and the hot chocolate is water plus a packet of Swiss Miss. Somehow mediocre skiing on icy small hills combined with mediocre food and basic accommodations equals a fun day for my family. Adding all kinds of elite amenities seems incongruous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amy, Connecticut\n",
    "\n",
    "Skiing in the Catskills isn't exactly brag-worthy for anyone who would purchase this membership. So it's likely to fail, but in failure will destroy a common resource. More and more understand that the rest of us will have nothing nice left if the wealthy continue to sequester themselves.\n",

    "baltcate, Florida\n",

    "The true ''ballers'' aren't skiing down a short run in marginal snow conditions. They're going out west or, at a minimum, Vermont. I like capitalism as much as anyone, but this profit-at-all-costs mentality and widening income inequality, where the wealthy have the skids greased for them in all ways, will be the downfall of us.\n",

    "Windham is a beautiful spot for families and anyone who appreciates skiing or snowboarding. Skiing has always been an expensive sport for a family. Buying lunch at a ski resort has always been expensive too, but the new food at Windham is really good, or bring your own. The changes I see so far are fantastic. Resorts need to evolve, and I am really encouraged to see the new investment in Windham.\n",

    "Next year could see increasing volatility as persistent military conflicts and economic uncertainty influence voting in national elections across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacks on crucial shipping traffic in the Red Sea straits by a determined band of militants in Yemen -- a spillover from the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza -- is injecting a new dose of instability into a world economy already struggling with mounting geopolitical tensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East is the latest in a string of unpredictable crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, that have landed like swipes of a bear claw on the global economy, smacking it off course and leaving scars.\n",
    "\n",
    "As if that weren't enough, more volatility lies ahead in the form of a wave of national elections whose repercussions could be deep and long. More than two billion people in roughly 50 countries, including India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, the United States and the 27 nations of the European Parliament, will head to the polls. Altogether, participants in 2024's elections olympiad account for 60 percent of the world's economic output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In robust democracies, elections are taking place as mistrust in government is rising, electorates are bitterly divided and there is a profound and abiding anxiety over economic prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in countries where elections are neither free nor fair, leaders are sensitive to the economy's health. President Vladimir V. Putin's decision this fall to require exporters to convert foreign currency into rubles was probably done with an eye on propping up the ruble and tamping down prices in the run-up to Russia's presidential elections in March.\n",
    "\n",
    "The winners will determine crucial policy decisions affecting factory subsidies, tax breaks, technology transfers, the development of artificial intelligence, regulatory controls, trade barriers, investments, debt relief and the energy transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rash of electoral victories that carry angry populists into power could push governments toward tighter control of trade, foreign investment and immigration. Such policies, said Diane Coyle, a professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, could tip the global economy into ''a very different world than the one that we have been used to.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In many places, skepticism about globalization has been fueled by stagnant incomes, declining standards of living and growing inequality. Nonetheless, Ms. Coyle said, ''a world of shrinking trade is a world of shrinking income.''\n",
    "\n",
    "And that raises the possibility of a ''vicious cycle,'' because the election of right-wing nationalists is likely to further weaken global growth and bruise economic fortunes, she warned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many economists have compared recent economic events to those of the 1970s, but the decade that Ms. Coyle said came to mind was the 1930s, when political upheavals and financial imbalances ''played out into populism and declining trade and then extreme politics.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest election next year is in India. Currently the world's fastest-growing economy, it is jockeying to compete with China as the world's manufacturing hub. Taiwan's presidential election in January has the potential to ratchet up tensions between the United States and China. In Mexico, the vote will affect the government's approach to energy and foreign investment. And a new president in Indonesia could shift policies on critical minerals like nickel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. presidential election, of course, will be the most significant by far for the world economy. The approaching contest is already affecting decision-making. Last week, Washington and Brussels agreed to suspend tariffs on European steel and aluminum and on American whiskey and motorcycles until after the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal enables President Biden to appear to take a tough stance on trade deals as he battles for votes. Former President Donald J. Trump, the likely Republican candidate, has championed protectionist trade policies and proposed slapping a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the United States -- a combative move that would inevitably lead other countries to retaliate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Trump, who has echoed authoritarian leaders, has also indicated that he would step back from America's partnership with Europe, withdraw support for Ukraine and pursue a more confrontational stance toward China.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The outcome of the elections could lead to far-reaching shifts in domestic and foreign policy issues, including on climate change, regulations and global alliances,'' the consulting firm EY-Parthenon concluded in a recent report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next year's global economic outlook so far is mixed. Growth in most corners of the world remains slow, and dozens of developing countries are in danger of defaulting on their sovereign debts. On the positive side of the ledger, the rapid fall in inflation is nudging central bankers to reduce interest rates or at least halt their rise. Reduced borrowing costs are generally a spur to investment and home buying.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the world continues to fracture into uneasy alliances and rival blocs, security concerns are likely to loom even larger in economic decisions than they have so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "China, India and Turkey stepped up to buy Russian oil, gas and coal after Europe sharply reduced its purchases in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, tensions between China and the United States spurred Washington to respond to years of strong-handed industrial support from Beijing by providing enormous incentives for electric vehicles, semiconductors and other items deemed essential for national security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea by Iranian-backed Houthi militia are a further sign of increasing fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last couple of months, there has been a rise in smaller players like Yemen, Hamas, Azerbaijan and Venezuela that are seeking to change the status quo, said Courtney Rickert McCaffrey, a geopolitical analyst at EY-Parthenon and an author of the recent report.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Even if these conflicts are smaller, they can still affect global supply chains in unexpected ways,'' she said. ''Geopolitical power is becoming more dispersed,'' and that increases volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Houthi assaults on vessels from around the world in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait -- the aptly named Gate of Grief -- on the southern end of the Red Sea have pushed up freight and insurance rates and oil prices while diverting marine traffic to a much longer and costlier route around Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, the United States said it would expand a military coalition to ensure the safety of ships passing through this commercial pathway, through which 12 percent of global trade passes. It is the biggest rerouting of worldwide trade since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the impact of the attacks had so far been limited. ''From an economic perspective, we're not seeing huge increase in oil and gas prices,'' Mr. Vistesen said, although he acknowledged that the Red Sea assaults were the ''most obvious near-term flashpoint.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty does have a dampening effect on the economy, though. Businesses tend to adopt a wait-and-see attitude when it comes to investment, expansions and hiring.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Continuing volatility in geopolitical and geoeconomic relations between major economies is the biggest concern for chief risk officers in both the public and private sectors,'' a midyear survey by the World Economic Forum found.\n",
    "\n",
    "With persistent military conflicts, increasing bouts of extreme weather and a slew of major elections ahead, it's likely that 2024 will bring more of the same.\n",

    "A lot of it is food: Grits, fried green tomatoes, sweet potato pie, divinity, corn nuggets, hot tamales and crawfish are just some of the delicacies he has discussed. He has done soliloquies on social protocol (a phone call should never end with a quick goodbye), language (defining ''might could'' and ''fixing to'') and Mississippi's climate (the humidity can feel like wearing ''a sweater full of Vaseline'').\n",
    "\n",
    "Since February, his ''Landon Talks'' posts have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers, many from around the world -- a testament to the odd fascination that has always surrounded the quirks, characters and complicated history of the South.\n",
    "\n",
    "But many of Mr. Bryant's regular viewers are about as Southern as he is, confirming another enduring truth about the region: There are few things Southerners love more than reveling in their own Southernness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments on his posts can be as engaging as the videos themselves: bountiful and passionate, but never all that heated. Take, for example, the thread on the region's superstitions. A bird flying in the house is a sign a loved one is about to die; a cardinal in the yard is a dead relative checking in.\n",
    "\n",
    "''In this time of turmoil and global unrest, it's kind of fun to think about deviled eggs,'' said one regular commenter, Patricia Altschul, the socialite and grande dame on the Bravo reality show ''Southern Charm.'' ''People do wrangle over a lot of these things that nobody else cares about besides Southerners.''\n",
    "\n",
    "As lighthearted as it all may seem, Mr. Bryant believes the conversation actually represents something more substantial: a sprawling family, rife with bitter disagreements and painful histories, unified by an abiding affection for home.\n",
    "\n",
    "His audience includes a certified ''Daughter of the Confederacy'' and one of the more liberal members of the Louisiana State Legislature. There are people from a mix of racial and economic backgrounds, as well as people who are gay and gender nonconforming. Their diversity might surprise some outsiders, but it reflects the geographic, racial, economic, ideological, gastronomical vastness of the South.\n",
    "\n",
    "''By breaking down our phrases, expressions and traditions, Landon reinforces that idea that there is a rich history and culture that exists in this area,'' said Claire Thriffiley, an Instagram follower of his and the director of an art gallery in New Orleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Bryant acknowledged that many of his videos are snapshots of a fading way of life. The matriarchs who set the standard for potato salad are aging or are already gone. ''Might could'' is heard less and less.\n",
    "\n",
    "The videos are also something of an informal historical record. ''It's just turned into this love letter,'' Mr. Bryant said in an interview in Laurel, Miss., his city of 17,000, where he lives on the same road where he grew up.\n",
    "\n",
    "But over time, he realized the videos and the conversations they spur were not just about remembering an idealized version of the past. This was a chance to figure out which Southern traditions were worth preserving, and which were best left behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Our generation is going to have to decide,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Bryant -- an elementary school art teacher until he became a full-time influencer -- makes no claim of being the definitive voice of the South, as if one could exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, regular viewers say that he is an ideal guide. ''Landon is funny and has a soft, calming voice,'' said Mandie Landry, a Democratic state lawmaker from New Orleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Very Mr. Rogers,'' she added. ''He could start a cult full of niceness and potato salad and I would join it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He never needed a camera or an Instagram account to launch into meandering monologues. His wife, Katelyn, encouraged him to start recording and posting them online -- if only to spare herself from being his only audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past year, his life has been transformed. He has a contract to write a book expanding on his videos. Lingua Franca, a New York-based purveyor of cashmere sweaters with hand-stitched messages, recently sold out a line featuring phrases from his videos, including ''Bless your heart'' and ''Might could.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of his posts include paid promotions where he mentions certain products, like White Lily flour and cornmeal mixes. Mr. Bryant also produces made-to-order videos ($50 a pop) for Cameo, the service offering individualized messages from personalities of varying renown. So far, he has been hired to share a message from one twin sister to another to stop spending money at Starbucks and to settle a dispute over whether to eat grits with salt and pepper or with sugar. (''There's no right way to eat grits,'' he said, ''as long as you're eating grits.'')\n",
    "\n",
    "One query about his favorite beverage (a French 75) turned into a meditation on drinking in the South. ''Southern people either do have a very favorite drink,'' he said, ''or you pretend you don't drink at all and you don't make eye contact in the liquor store.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Strangers recognize him in public now, including on a recent family vacation to Disney World. The attention has been surreal, he said, and even a little uncomfortable. Still, he noticed that entry-level celebrity did not feel all that different from living under the watchful eye of a small town.\n",
    "\n",
    "As he ran errands in Laurel on a recent afternoon, a man hollered at him from a passing pickup: ''Can I have your autograph, Landon?'' It turned out to be his wife's cousin's husband.\n",
    "\n",
    "His wife, who was one of his best friends growing up, has been astonished at how his emergence as a social media influencer has drawn Mr. Bryant out of his shyness but not so surprised at the connection he has made with viewers. ''It feels like he's talking with you,'' she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has the observational skills often developed by those who feel like an outsider in the place that is supposed to be home. As a boy, he was small and a bit awkward -- he needed to ''grow into his ears,'' as he put it -- and he preferred eavesdropping on the ladies at the beauty shop to hunting, sports or the other rugged pursuits of the men who surrounded him. For a while, he would even try to lower his voice to better fit that mold of masculinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet the whirlwind of the past year has taught him that perhaps he is not as much of an outsider as he once thought. ''I didn't realize how much of this place I am,'' he said. ''I am also a Southern man -- whatever that means for me.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He keeps a list of possible video topics on his phone, and he continually finds new inspiration, including just the other day, when his grandmother stopped by and he asked how she was feeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "''She literally said to me, 'I'd have to feel better to die,''' he said. He made a mental note to put that on the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "He wants to make it a year before he revisits any topics. But after that, he would like to correct the record on a few items -- namely, deviled eggs. In his first video about them, he mentioned topping them with cracker crumbs. The backlash was swift.\n",
    "\n",
    "He is eager to explain himself. But he also wants to remind his followers that he knows his place when it comes to a potluck.\n",
    "\n",
    "He's the one bringing the paper plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since February, Landon Bryant's posts on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube about Southern customs and mannerisms have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers, many from around the world -- a testament to the odd fascination that has always surrounded the region.; Mr. Bryant, an elementary school art teacher until he became a full-time influencer, often records his videos at home in his bedroom, left. He lives with his wife, Katelyn, son, Charlie, and dog, Kobe, on the same road in Laurel, Miss., where he grew up. ''I didn't realize how much of this place I am,'' he said.

    "Spruce Pine, N.C., is not nearly as famous as Asheville, an epicenter of haute hill culture about an hour's drive away. But if you were hoping to fill your Instagram feed with Blue Ridge sunsets and bespoke cocktails, be sure to thank the ''obscure Appalachian backwater,'' as Wired once called Spruce Pine, whose two mines produce the world's largest supply of an exceptionally pure quartz needed to manufacture the semiconductors in our smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Here's something scary,'' a mining expert tells the science writer Ed Conway, in MATERIAL WORLD: The Six Raw Materials That Shape Modern Civilization (Knopf, 502 pp., $35), his lively new book about the extraction and manufacture of the materials (salt, sand, lithium, iron, copper and oil) without which modern life would be impossible. ''If you flew over the two mines in Spruce Pine with a crop duster loaded with a very particular powder, you could end the world's production of semiconductors and solar panels within six months.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Everywhere, Conway sees the tragic ironies of progress. Discoursing on the enormous greenhouse gas emissions used to produce cement, he points out that, decades ago, Soviet scientists invented a more sustainable form of the material that uses industrial byproducts. This alkali-activated cement was used for construction in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city largely destroyed by Russian forces last year. Thus, ''one of the best clues we have about how to mass-produce this magical material without causing such damage to the planet,'' Conway writes, was turned to dust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deb Chachra's HOW INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS: Inside the Systems That Shape Our World (Riverhead, 308 pp., $29) treads similar ground, but more clumsily. A professor at the Olin College of Engineering who teaches about the intersection of technology and culture, Chachra would seem to be perfectly equipped to act as our Virgil through the built environment -- highways and sewer pipes, electrical substations, bridges, those weird poles that recently sprouted like alien superweeds around New York -- constructed out of the materials Conway describes. And there are plenty of opportunities for ''Infrastructure Week'' jokes, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, Chachra traffics in vaguely optimistic bromides: ''Functional infrastructure is resilient infrastructure,'' she writes in a typical pronouncement. ''Networks are inherently collective, not individual.'' Well, yes: That's what makes them networks. I kept waiting for Chachra to take a deep dive, but she insistently stays on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "She does perceptively note that to ''capitalism, sustainability always looks like underutilization,'' but doesn't give this important issue the treatment it deserves. To the contrary, she has a tendency to slip into a techno-optimism that looks increasingly unwarranted: ''Access to abundant energy with no fuel costs will make it possible to build out a technological world that's modeled on the natural one, a world where reuse of matter is the default,'' she writes, describing a post-carbon future that recent debates over wind farms and solar arrays suggest will not enjoy an easy or imminent birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was particularly disturbed by her assertion that ''responding to climate change is not about making sacrifice.'' While one hopes that she is justified in believing that we ''are not doomed to a dystopian future of failing systems,'' that prediction will only be realized if we swear off some of the material comforts that we have come to expect as our birthright. The answer cannot lie with transnational corporations whose solutions involve little more than clever rebranding or gestural philanthropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how did we get here, a genius species courting its own demise? Our fraught ingenuity is the subject of Roma Agrawal's NUTS & BOLTS: Seven Small Inventions That Changed the World (in a Big Way) (Norton, 258 pp., $29.99), which devotes chapters to feats of engineering (nails, lenses, springs, strings, pumps, magnets and wheels) that, she argues, form ''the basis of the modern world.'' I commend anyone brave enough to describe can openers as ''interesting little tools.'' She is fascinated by nails, too, and gifted enough a writer to make that fascination infectious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, Agrawal engages in illuminating historical asides on figures like the aviator Polina Gelman, the only Jewish woman to be honored as a Hero of the Soviet Union during World War II, and Josephine Cochrane, who invented the first dishwasher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less auspicious is Agrawal's tendency to slip in progressive homilies that, beyond their narrative discordance, detract from the overall credibility of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a chapter about lenses, for example, she describes how the camera was ''used in many countries by colonizers to exert power over the colonized.'' This is true, and rather obviously so, but does it belong here? I had a similar question at the conclusion of an instructive section that capably explained the workings of the breast pump, a device that has been a lifesaver to many families. That passage also succumbs to didactics: ''It's important to remember that it's not necessary to be a cis woman or to have been pregnant to breastfeed or to benefit from using a breast pump,'' Agrawal writes, later adding that ''it's vital that the needs of all types of breastfeeding parents are incorporated into the design.''\n",
    "\n",
    "It is indeed important to consider the rights and needs of transgender people in many areas of modern life, especially in our age of rising intolerance, but consigning the community to a few virtue-signaling lines seems cheap and cynical. For that matter, the science of gender transition is immensely complex and in some respects unsettled, never more so than when it comes to pregnancy. A science writer should, at least, acknowledge those complexities -- especially when writing a book devoted to the very complexity of our world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Conway, Agrawal deals frankly with the challenges of a thoroughly technologized society. ''The greater the complexity in the design and materials of an object,'' she writes, ''the harder it is to separate them out again, meaning they often end up in the landfill.'' The pure quartz extracted from the mines of Spruce Pine and turned into crucial smartphone components will, after a couple of years of dutiful neuron-decaying service, end up in an electronics dump in India or Ghana. There, children will pick through the trash, risking their own health in an effort to once more extract the materials that power our world. And we will call it progress.\n",

    "If you own a dog and have ever searched the internet for advice on that dog, there's a good chance you've encountered Zak George.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. George, a 45-year-old with 3.69 million YouTube followers and the slightly goofy, hyper energy of a doodle mix, is the most popular dog trainer on the platform. He's the most popular by a long shot: Cesar Millan, the dog whisperer, has 2.71 million. Those trying to deride Mr. George -- and there are many -- will often say he stopped being a dog trainer a long time ago; what he is now is a dog influencer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've watched Mr. George's videos for years; I deployed them as background noise while doing dishes or folding laundry. I watched as he worked with untrained rescue dogs to prepare them for new homes. I watched as he road-tripped across the country in a camper van with his two dogs and his wife. Every once in a while, there were hints that he had bigger things on his mind: his videos in which he said the dog training industry needed to confront its ''misogyny,'' for instance. But mostly his content consisted of him training his dogs: Inertia, a black and white Border collie, and Veronica, a rescue mutt with a cute underbite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, around this time last year, I watched, transfixed, as Mr. George began launching broadsides against an approach to training dogs known as balanced training (more on just what that is in a moment). In video after video, he declared that the dog training industry had reached a crisis point and that it was time for a reckoning with those in the profession who train with what are called aversives -- tools that cause a dog discomfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "The videos did what they were intended to do: They sparked a response. But not just any response. Comment sections filled with discussions on ''woke idiots'' in dog training. ''Radicals Are Hijacking Dog Training,'' posted one trainer, calling force-free training, the anti-aversive movement of which Mr. George is arguably the most prominent face, an ''ideology'' and a ''cult'' with a ''radicalized agenda'' -- language that sounded awfully familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before this, I'd seen the occasional Instagram post by a trainer using terminology that seemed drawn from another context: I'd paused on several posts that applied the term ''consent'' to dogs -- as in, we should get their consent before we pet them. In some cases, the trainer's vocabulary seemed drawn from even more distant shores: ''I will not project colonial, capitalist, or patriarchal concepts on my dog,'' one post read, in between tips on leash reactivity and separation anxiety; ''don't gaslight your dog,'' another urged.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Mr. George's series of videos seemed to send whatever process had generated those posts into overdrive. ''It sounds like dog training has become just one more target for the woke community to prey upon!'' a YouTube user wrote. ''These are the same people with 'gender fluid' dogs,'' another wrote, a statement that I found funny, then spent too long trying to parse. (What is standard gender expression in dogs?) I watched a video in which a trainer referred to the ''dog training far left,'' which should have made no sense, except that at this point, I knew what he meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, I watched this confusing web of associations go unquestioned; when I found commenters who shared my bewilderment, I screenshotted them with relief. ''People are trying to conflate their anti-liberal politics with dog training,'' a YouTube user named Bar posted, adding that it's ''super weird.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it would be silly to say that dogs can't be political: Anyone who has seen photos of German shepherds at civil rights marches should appreciate that they can.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there seemed to be something different about what was happening here. The creep of this sort of language into a subject this far afield felt like the apotheosis of something. When I'd describe what I'd seen to friends, it often sparked a visceral combination of exhaustion and despair. (''I kind of hate knowing about this,'' one said. ''We deserve climate change,'' another said.) These were the late-stage culture wars -- in decline, perhaps, but still with enough life left to flare up and set fire to new and unexpected territory. Including dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface, the dispute Mr. George threw himself into centered on a long-running debate: Should you make a dog physically uncomfortable as a means of changing its behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "Force-free training -- or positive reinforcement training, as it's often called -- in the simplest terms rejects the use of physical punishments, known as corrections. Dogs are trained not through punishing the bad behavior but by rewarding the good: A dog sitting politely on his bed while his owners eat dinner should be showered with treats, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few trainers today would take issue with the idea of positively reinforcing a behavior you like. Where things get more contentious is what to do about behavior you don't like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of positive reinforcement training say you stop bad behavior through a combination of management measures (drawing the curtains for a dog that won't stop barking at passers-by) and reinforcing alternative behaviors you prefer (giving treats to reward moments of not barking). A balanced trainer, by contrast, might suggest a bark collar -- a device that emits a negative stimulus like a shock or a high-pitched sound whenever the dog gets set off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who argue for the end of punishment say that, at best, it's unnecessary and unethical and, at worst, can have unintended consequences: A punished dog might become more fearful and therefore more likely to bite. Those who argue that corrections have their place say that positive training too often prioritizes the dog's comfort over the owner's and that in extreme cases, tools like e-collars and prong collars are the only way to handle dogs that would otherwise be put down for aggression. Positive trainers have the backing of organizations like the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior; balanced trainers dismiss such organizations as at odds with their real-world experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is emotive territory and can certainly make for a tense argument. But it still didn't seem like enough to account for how, in a world already awash with political shorthand, dog training methods had seemingly become yet another signifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Was it just coincidence that so many balanced trainers seemed to be men in tight shirts who trained Belgian Malinois in protection sports? Why did positive trainers seem to post so often about mental health (canine and human) -- and why did so many balanced trainers complain about dogs being overmedicated? Why did so many positive trainers talk about following the science and so many balanced trainers talk about science having an agenda? Each of these questions, taken on their own, had an explanation. Taken together, they managed to map out the battle lines of the culture wars with unsettling precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, I'd wonder if I was making too much of what I'd seen. After all, a majority of owners were almost certainly blissfully unaware of these dynamics. Had I become too online about dogs, of all things, animals notorious for insisting you touch grass twice a day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I would stumble on something that stunned me anew with its insistence that dog training methods were a cultural front line -- ''balanced trainers who try to paint themselves as 'the nice guys' will also be the target of the woke mob'' -- and I would feel a renewed sense that what I was seeing was very real and was simultaneously both absurd and terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a way of seeing what has unfolded in dog training as a function of the internet and social platforms. Dog training has taken readily to video-based platforms like YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, which lend themselves to demonstrating physical skills. It also requires no certification process, an approach that aligns with the ethos of the internet, where anyone can claim to be anything and scrollers are left on their own to determine credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few years, these factors combined with the Covid pandemic, which sent a wave of new dog owners onto the internet looking for help, to draw yet more trainers online. Today the world of online dog training can be overwhelming: Who actually knows what they're talking about? How is an owner to gauge whose advice to take?\n",
    "\n",
    "What I was seeing was, in part, dog training just adopting internet-y language. These platforms are where we consume everything now: politics, culture, entertainment, said Robert Topinka, who studies digital culture at Birkbeck, University of London. They each have their own grammar, syntax, vocabulary and aesthetics. Shorthand bleeds easily from one subject to another. Thus, the idea that you don't need to exercise authority through fear while training becomes ''Don't be a cop to your dog.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Faced with more information than anyone can possibly sort through, Dr. Topinka said, users tend to judge creators by affect and vibes. In 2023 one ready way to signal a vibe is either wokeness or anti-wokeness. And so: Who should I turn to to figure out how to train my dog to walk on a leash? The guy who insists he's not going to be politically correct about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this explanation may imply a level of calculation that's not quite right. Everyone I spoke to for this story was deeply sincere (these are, after all, dog people): ''The world of dogs does not exist in a vacuum of pet guardian and pet but is interconnected with systemic oppression,'' Rachel Forday, a positive trainer, told me when I asked about her use of political language. ''Systemic oppression dictates who is allowed to own a dog and what kind of dog they own.'' Robert Cabral, a balanced trainer, worried in one of his videos that the rise of science citations in dog training was turning the profession into an ''elitist realm.'' ''I have an issue with that,'' he said. ''I'm a simple guy. I didn't go to college.'' He continued, ''I think when you make things complicated, you cut out a lot of good people.'' The vibes these people are projecting are simply who they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "But ''vibes generate their own momentum,'' Dr. Topinka said. They feed off the vibes of other creators; they encourage stridency and positioning within an ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite having begun a high-profile anti-balanced-training campaign, Mr. George didn't, at first, seem particularly inclined to draw a connection between training methods and politics. Over time, though, I noticed this shifting: In an Instagram Live video in late summer, for example, he and his wife covered subjects ranging from pronouns and trans rights to racism in policing to toxic masculinity and how all of these subjects, in some way, relate back to dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Was this a case of vibes generating their own momentum?\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally spoke to Mr. George in September. During our conversation, he agreed that he was talking about these subjects more; he seemed to see it as simply a growing willingness on his part to draw valid connections between dog training and cultural issues. Our conversation reminded me that in some articulations, there is nothing so outlandish about the idea that a person's worldview might shape the way he trains dogs. The reasons people train with aversive tools are multifaceted, he told me, and not all of it has to do with their politics. But some of it does: The still pervasive idea that in training, humans have to establish dominance, for instance -- it's not such a stretch to connect that to societal ideas about masculinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our conversation was also a reminder that flattening everything we discuss on the internet into the same debate -- one that follows the same scripts and uses the same shorthand -- is actually not great if the goal is a productive discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the term ''consent'' to the question of petting dogs stood out to me in this regard: We might flinch at the word being used in this context, but most people, balanced trainers included, would agree that it's important to recognize when a dog doesn't want to be touched. A contentious term was masking an area of agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I brought up consent with Mr. George, though, he jumped to defend it: ''People have a visceral reaction: How dare we say that dogs need to consent?'' he said. ''And actually, that underscores a lot of the toxic masculinity that we have.'' When I stopped him to clarify that the objections I'd heard were not about toxic masculinity but about the implied equivalence between sexual assault and unwanted dog petting, he paused; he genuinely seemed not to have thought of it that way before. I asked if using a less loaded term could be a better approach for discussing the actual topic at hand. He conceded it probably would.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time we were speaking, Mr. George's war against balanced training had taken a notable twist: He was now leading what could only be described as a full-fledged cancellation campaign against another dog trainer -- a particularly egregious one, whose tactics some balanced trainers disparaged, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This certainly felt like an escalation. Mr. George was calling for his followers to show up and protest at this trainer's events, to contact venues that host him and leave them bad reviews; he was tagging institutions and other prominent dog trainers, urging them to issue statements. Between mid-August, when he started the campaign, and mid-September, when we spoke, he had posted on Instagram dozens of times. A vast majority of those posts had been about this trainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Was this an instance of vibes generating their own momentum? Mr. George's commitment to force-free dog training is deeply held and, again, undeniably sincere. He told me he wasn't doing this for engagement or clicks, and this also seemed true. His most popular videos on YouTube, by far, have nothing to do with the dog training wars; they're tips on how to train a puppy. And that other trainer really is egregious.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the campaign seemed perfectly calibrated to validate the perspectives of those who previously sounded hysterical and overwrought. In other words, it looked like a woke dog-training mob, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another way of thinking about what's happened here that's not so much about the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2017 paper, a Norwegian researcher, Ane Moller Gabrielsen, detailed a strange phenomenon: Dog training in Norway had also divided into two camps, which essentially mirrored those in the United States -- positive training (via a device called a clicker) and ''traditional'' training. Those camps, too, had mapped onto a social divide, but it was a slightly different one: not woke and anti-woke but women and men.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not necessarily the case that more women trained one way and more men trained another, Dr. Gabrielsen found. (There were more female trainers than male trainers across all forms of training.) But the training methods had become gendered. Advertisements for Canis, the country's main positive-training institution, ''often featured women succeeding at clicker training while several men watched with disbelief,'' Dr. Gabrielsen wrote. By contrast, Hundefaggruppen, the traditionalist training school, ''often presented clicker trainers as naïve young girls.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gabrielsen's work seemed to describe a phenomenon similar to the one I observed in a very different social context. When we spoke, she said she'd thought about my questions: Was this about social media? 2023? She wanted to offer another idea: This was about dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, both methods of training -- positive training and balanced training -- work, she said. With time and consistency, effort and skill, both will, in most cases, give you a dog that behaves the way you want it to. Dogs, so highly attuned to humans, have lived with us for a long time; they're good at understanding what we want from them. But as a result, they become vehicles for our self-expression in a way that most other animals do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dogs are where we project our ''fantasies about what we want -- either who we want to be or what we want the world to look like,'' said Katharine Mershon, a professor of religion and philosophy at Western Carolina University who studies the role of dogs in American society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Mershon told me how dogs had become a focal point for tensions in her rural Appalachian town: Her local NextDoor was filled with arguments about whether leaving hunting dogs to roam about freely, slightly underfed and living mostly outside, constituted abuse. This was an argument, ostensibly about dogs, that was actually about gentrification and the place of newcomers to impose their values on local life.\n",
    "\n",
    "At points in my conversations with Dr. Gabrielsen and Dr. Mershon, we discussed the poet, philosopher and animal trainer Vicki Hearne. ''Dogs are domesticated to, and into, us,'' Ms. Hearne wrote in her 1986 book ''Adam's Task.'' ''And we are domesticated to, and into, them.''\n",
    "\n",
    "No neutral observer in dog training's internecine fights, Ms. Hearne was brutal to the point of being genuinely shocking in her training methods. She railed in her writing against the sanctimoniousness of those who she felt refused to respect dogs enough to let them earn the consequences of their choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "But among the various points she stressed in ''Adam's Task'' -- her effort to bridge the gap between academia and animal training -- was humanity's capacity for telling itself stories about dogs and horses, the creatures we've bred to accompany us through the human world. We see what we want to in them; they respond to our vision. ''Quarrels about training technique are almost never about whatever the surface issue appears to be,'' she wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's so easy to project ideas of discipline and loyalty and obedience and all this strong leadership -- it's so easy to project that upon dog training,'' Dr. Gabrielsen told me. ''But at the same, it's just as easy to project ideals of democracy, equality, reward-based, no-punishment, because it all works.''\n",
    "\n",
    "From this perspective, it's not that the structures of the internet ensure that the culture wars will come for every subject; it's that the culture wars were inevitably going to come for dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confession -- and it's something you might have guessed already: I first found myself going down this particular rabbit hole because of a problem with my own dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "About two and a half years ago, on a sunny summer morning, Finn, our spaniel-greyhound-saluki mix, chased after a jogger. He'd never done it before, and even as I cringed and went to collect him, I hoped that this might be a one-off thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't. I still live in fear that the photo the jogger rage-took of us after Finn bounded after him will surface on social media, even though I apologized profusely. During this period, I spent hours online looking for answers on how to deal with my problem animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. George was my first stop on this journey. After I followed him on Instagram, the algorithm kicked in, offering me content from other positive training accounts, too. Was I dogfluenced? I'm not sure, but eventually, I opted for a solution to my dog's jogger chasing that is very common in positive reinforcement training (though is used by some balanced trainers, too): I started using a ridiculously long leash. It is 32 feet long, long enough that we can play a real game of fetch while he's wearing it, but I can still grab it and reel him in quickly if he misbehaves. It's so long that it often attracts comments and questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another confession: At some point, I started thinking about getting an e-collar for my dog. He seemed, in some ways, an ideal candidate: neither aggressive nor fearful, just a dog who might get to run around a little more freely if I could make it very clear that chasing joggers was not, in fact, a fun game.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never did it. I don't exactly know why; I can't untangle my bundle of motivations well enough to fully understand them. Was I worried about being a cop to my dog? Was I just not the kind of person who uses e-collars? (In signifier terms, I'm not.) Did I simply just not want to buzz him if he did something bad? I definitely didn't, but I can't confidently say that was the only impulse at work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're living through a funny juncture when it comes to the culture wars and the internet. The structures of the internet are evolving at the same time that the grounds on which the culture wars are being fought are shifting. Even over the past few months, I've felt a subtle tenor change across this particular slice of the web. It's not that the temperature of the dog training wars has gone down; if anything, it may be going up -- Mr. George has begun talking about pursuing legislation against aversive tools. But the trainers do seem to be, in a hard-to-pin-down way, more focused on dogs: Fewer threads about training techniques are devolving into fights about vaccines; I've seen very few major dog accounts venture an opinion about Israel and Gaza. Whether, in a few years' time, we'll emerge in a place where it still behooves people who train dogs to give off a politically tinged vibe and whether owners like me will still internalize those vibes, we'll see. What does seem guaranteed -- and is, frankly, kind of a bummer -- is that regardless of what happens with this particular iteration of the culture wars, dogs will always be destined to become goofy, oblivious vehicles for human conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand: What do they care, really? Finn and I still take walks with the giant leash. I still get comments on it and fight the urge to feel self-conscious. Finn, for his part, doesn't really seem to mind and probably doesn't know what he's missing.\n",

    "A camera found in the ice after nearly 50 years stirs old questions about the deaths of two American climbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "High on Aconcagua, the Western Hemisphere's highest mountain, the shrinking Polish Glacier spits out what it once devoured -- in this case, a 50-year-old Nikomat 35-millimeter camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two porters, preparing for an upcoming expedition, had been securing ropes in the thin and arid air of a clear February day. It was midsummer in South America. The camera glistened in the sun, daring to be noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lens was shattered. A dial on top showed that 24 photographs had been taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom half of the camera was saddled into a worn leather holster with a thick strap. On the holster, in blue embossing tape, was an American name and a Colorado address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the snow-and-ice seasonal cycles of the mountains, abandoned and lost equipment is discovered each summer -- tattered tents, dropped ice axes, lost mittens. Occasionally, a body.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was not just another camera, though the porters did not know that yet. One of them carried it down to camp. There, a veteran guide named Ulises Corvalán was cooking lunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corvalán glanced up. He casually asked about the name on the bottom of the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Janet Johnson,'' came the reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corvalán gasped and swore. ''Janet Johnson!?'' he shouted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excitement boiled instantly. Do you know about Janet Johnson, the schoolteacher? About John Cooper, the NASA engineer? About the deadly 1973 American expedition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you heard the legend?\n",
    "\n",
    "It had been handed down for decades, veering toward myth, whispered like a ghost story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what was certain: A woman from Denver, maybe the most accomplished climber in the group, had last been seen alive on the glacier. A man from Texas, part of the recent Apollo missions to the moon, lay frozen nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were contradictory statements from survivors and a hasty departure. There was a judge who demanded an investigation into possible foul play. There were three years of summit-scratching searches to find and retrieve the bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their discovery stirred more intrigue, leaving more questions than answers. That's the imbalance of all the best mysteries -- facts that don't quite add up, gaps that imaginations rush to fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is how Janet Johnson and John Cooper became part of the folklore of Aconcagua.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, nearly five decades later, an old camera had emerged from the receding glacier. It was wound, prepared to take the next picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "More clues emerged from the ice. Here was a decomposed left arm, still wearing a delicate silver Rado watch with a broken blue face. There was a tattered pack and scattered belongings: down mittens, a red jacket, a single crampon, a canister of used Kodak film.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like that, by the whims of climate change and chance, a long-lost legend was given air and light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Team\n",
    "\n",
    "Aconcagua is the broad-shouldered behemoth of the Andes, shaped more like a fist than a finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is brown and rocky, scrubby and dusty, dry and wind-whipped. With few trees or wildflowers, it can feel like a vertical desert.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first person known to reach the 22,838-foot summit was Matthias Zurbriggen of Switzerland, in 1897. In 1934, a Polish expedition successfully tackled a more perilous route on the northeastern side of Aconcagua, up a massive glacier that stretches nearly 2,000 vertical feet toward the summit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ice sheet was named for that group: El Glaciar de los Polacos. The Polish Glacier.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, Aconcagua is part of a vast state park with helpful rangers and a helicopter rescue service. Two base camps provide hot meals, showers and internet. Some consider Aconcagua among the easiest to climb of the Seven Summits, the prestigious name given the highest mountains on each continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Aconcagua is not easy. Trouble lurks in the thin air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through 2022, there were 153 known deaths on the mountain. In 1973, Johnson and Cooper were Nos. 26 and 27.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fifty years ago, Aconcagua had only the most rudimentary of services. Climbers had no GPS trackers, no way to communicate between base camp and the summit. The Americans carried binoculars and a flare gun.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mountain was virtually deserted. If trouble came, there was nobody to help but the other members of the expedition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Climbing Party\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of them were part of the Mazamas climbing club, founded in Oregon in 1894. Their leader was a Portland lawyer named Carmie Dafoe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dafoe, 52, pushed for the Aconcagua trip, noting that a Mazamas member had climbed it in the 1940s. His group, Dafoe announced, would attempt to be the fifth expedition to top Aconcagua via the Polish Route.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Difficulties are said to be moderate -- a couple of places where we'll want handlines -- not any more difficult than the normal route on Mt. McKinley,'' Dafoe wrote in a 1972 memo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The guide would be Miguel Alfonso, a 38-year-old Argentine who had been to the summit five times, once up the Polish Route. Dafoe asked for a $50 deposit from anyone interested, along with a list of successful ascents and references.\n",
    "\n",
    "In June 1972, Dafoe announced the members of the party, all American men, whom he briefly described. Jim Petroske, a psychiatrist from Portland, Ore., would be ''deputy leader,'' he said. Bill Eubank, a physician from Kansas City, Mo., was ''highly recommended by Petroske'' and would be the expedition doctor. Then came Arnold McMillen, a dairy farmer from Otis, Ore., and Bill Zeller, a police officer in Salem, Ore. (''Bill and I shared a blizzard in the Canadian Rockies in '69, a solid citizen.'') John Shelton, 25, was a Brigham Young geology student fluent in Spanish from a two-year church mission. (''Been through Latin American customs about 25 times -- which must take more energy than climbing Aconcagua.'') And John Cooper, a NASA engineer from Houston, was ''highly recommended.''\n",
    "\n",
    "They were weekend climbers, mostly. Dafoe organized hikes in the Northwest designed as training and get-to-know-you exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I have had some trepidation about the party because of a fear that we might have someone who has unknown problems or who is some kind of a fink,'' Dafoe wrote in a memo to the group. ''It turned out, however, that I either know everyone in the group, or they are people I have been able to find out about. This leaves me with no reservation or qualification about the party.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In November, Dafoe sent reminders about packing lists, passports, vaccinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Everyone is probably already rounding into top physical condition,'' he added. ''Don't take any chances on this. Work hard at it; especially with lots of jogging.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He also announced the final member of the eight-person American crew: a woman from Denver named Janet Johnson.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was born on Nov. 30, 1936, and never knew her birth mother. She was adopted by Victor and Mae Johnson, who lived in a stone-and-timber Tudor on the south side of Minneapolis. He helped run his family's paper-supply company; she was a bookkeeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Johnsons believed in manners, rules and God. Janet, with a tidy bedroom upstairs, was a quiet girl and a voracious reader. She needed glasses early. She played organ at St. John's Lutheran Church.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she was 10, she wanted a baby sister, so the Johnsons adopted a 5-year-old girl named Judie. The new sisters met at the neighborhood park. Janet took Judie home and gave her a doll named Lois.\n",
    "\n",
    "Janet never married or had children. Judie Abrahamson, now an 83-year-old widow in Oregon City, Ore., is the only close relative alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "''She liked to study -- that was her favorite thing to do,'' Abrahamson said. ''Straight A's? She would settle for nothing less.''\n",
    "\n",
    "It was when her sister was away at college that Abrahamson discovered notes hidden in a jewelry box -- love notes between her sister and another young woman. Soon, Johnson's parents sent her to a hospital in St. Paul to ''cure'' her of her homosexuality. She was about 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It didn't heal her,'' Abrahamson said. ''But that was a big rift between Janet and my mother.''\n",
    "\n",
    "It chased Johnson away from home. She settled in Denver, renting part of a two-story home on York Street, near the botanic gardens where she volunteered. She got her teaching certificate, then a master's degree, eventually a Ph.D. in education at the University of Colorado. She taught in elementary schools and then became a school librarian, figuring it would be easier to keep her nights and weekends free for the mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson joined the Colorado Mountain Club. By 30, she became the 82nd known person -- and among the first 20 women -- to reach the summit of each of Colorado's ''fourteeners,'' the more than 50 peaks higher than 14,000 feet in elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her name was regularly in the club's magazine, Trail and Timberline, detailing various excursions. Photos she took graced the magazine's cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The companionship on the outing was tremendous -- that is, except for the wood ticks, which somehow managed to find their way into my abode on the top of the hill,'' she wrote in a 1961 report about a weekend trip in the Rockies. ''Strangely enough, few other people even found one tick. Why they picked on me, I don't know. They say everyone was put here for a purpose, so maybe I was meant to sustain the ticks.''\n",
    "\n",
    "More and more, Johnson headed overseas. She was one of 38 members of a 1963 club expedition in Peru. On the way home, she detoured to climb Iztaccíhuatl, which rises more than 17,000 feet near Mexico City.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unclear how many of the world's summits she reached. She climbed Kilimanjaro and hoped to climb Denali after returning from Aconcagua.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most summers, Johnson tied a kayak atop her Nash Rambler and headed to the Northwest. She would stay with her sister, hike Mount Hood and paddle in Puget Sound. Abrahamson's children knew her as Aunt Janet, the free spirit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1971, the graduation announcements for her Ph.D., sent out by her mother, included a formal portrait of Johnson, smiling with her cat-eye glasses on.\n",
    "\n",
    "She wanted to reach the highest levels of education. She wanted to reach the top of the tallest mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think it was just to prove to my mother that she can do these things, even as a gay person,'' Abrahamson said.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Johnson had a significant other, Abrahamson never knew of her. Boxes of slides that she left behind show mostly landscapes, not people.\n",
    "\n",
    "She took the 1972-73 school year off. That fall, after a hiking trip in Europe, she proudly joined the upcoming Mazamas expedition to Aconcagua.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Climbed all 67 of the 14,000-foot peaks in the United States (except Alaska), Kilimanjaro, Orizaba, Popocatépetl, Iztaccíhuatl, Fuji, Mt. Blanc, Matterhorn, Eiger, Peru, etc., etc.,'' Dafoe wrote of Johnson. ''Recommended by two of my climbing friends from Denver.''\n",
    "\n",
    "She packed her belongings into an aluminum-frame backpack -- boots, flannel shirts, a red down jacket, thick mittens, glacier glasses, a sleeping bag. She used a marker to write her name or initials on most of them. She wore a silver watch and a ring with a brown stone that she got on a trip to New Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "And she brought the Nikomat, the consumer version of Nikon's professional cameras of the era. She probably bought the camera during her trip to Japan a couple of years earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "She used a label maker to punch her name and address onto blue embossing tape, and stuck it to the bottom of the leather camera case, just in case she lost it.\n",
    "\n",
    "She carried the camera with her to Aconcagua, taking photographs along the way, almost to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Climb\n",
    "\n",
    "American newspapers sent them off, and Argentine newspapers greeted them at the Nutibara Hotel in Mendoza's city center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rafael Morán, a reporter for Los Andes, a daily newspaper in Mendoza, interviewed the mountaineers near the pool. He did not cover every Aconcagua expedition, but this one was especially intriguing: Americans. The Polish Glacier. A woman. A NASA scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morán quickly had a dark inkling about this group. The Americans seemed disconnected from one another and unprepared for the serious task of climbing Aconcagua.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morán whispered to the photographer: Take each of their photos today. I don't think they're all coming back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next day's newspaper previewed the planned ascent. It showed the Americans huddled around a photo of Aconcagua. The caption noted the NASA engineer at the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a month before, in December 1972, John Cooper was at mission control in Houston for the 17th and final Apollo mission, wearing a black mustache and a headset, communicating with astronauts on the moon. Cooper was a surface operations engineer, helping guide the lunar module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooper also wore his new mountain-climbing boots to work, to break them in for what he anticipated would be a difficult expedition on Aconcagua.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooper grew up in El Dorado, Kan., with a love of the outdoors. He went to Oklahoma University to get a degree in geological engineering, but the flat oil fields where his father worked were not for him. He spent college summers working for the Forest Service and then as a smoke jumper in the American West.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, in the U.S. Coast Guard, he became a pilot and won awards for rescues off the coast of Florida and in the Caribbean. He learned to deep-sea dive.\n",
    "\n",
    "And he climbed. Cooper summited Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, the tallest mountains in Africa, and Popocatépetl, the volcanic behemoth in Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1966, Cooper joined NASA just as the Apollo program got underway. He had a bit of swashbuckler in him, more like an astronaut than a desk engineer. He sometimes wore a beard. He smoked a pipe. Around NASA's Houston campus, Cooper drove an old military Jeep, sometimes taking his nieces for a ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "''My mother would say, 'John, you put the doors back on and put up that windshield before you take my girls with you,''' Deb Koons, Cooper's niece, said.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was at NASA that Cooper fell in love with a secretary, a young divorced woman named Sandy Myers. They were married in 1968. In 1969, they had a baby boy they called Randy.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was the year of Apollo 11. Cooper was in the surface operations group that guided Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as they became the first humans to walk on the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three years later, on Dec. 19, 1972, Apollo 17's three-man crew splashed down safely in the South Pacific.\n",
    "\n",
    "On. Jan. 12, 1973, Cooper's flight from Houston landed in Miami, where he met Janet Johnson. They flew together to Argentina.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooper kept a diary of his expedition. Like other men in the group who wrote in their own diaries about Johnson -- ''Nothing feminine about her,'' one said -- Cooper was unsure what to make of the only woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Janet sure is weird,'' he wrote from the comfort of Hotel Nutibara. ''She went swimming in her bra, blouse and panties today and the pool was full of people!''\n",
    "\n",
    "On the mountain, the Americans struggled from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Jan. 20, 1973, aided by mules, the group hiked 25 miles to Casa de Piedra, a stone house at the confluence of the Vacas and Relinchos Rivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his diary, Cooper described the ''stark beauty'' of a landscape ''baked hard as concrete.'' He mentioned that Eubank, the expedition doctor, was already sick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next day, the group reached base camp, a treeless, rubbled plot in a wide valley at about 13,500 feet. These days, during climbing season, it is a buzzing village. In 1973, the American expedition members were the only ones there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alfonso had hired Roberto Bustos, a 25-year-old climber and student, to manage the base camp. Now a retired geography professor in Buenos Aires, Bustos recalled his early impression of the group -- a lot of high-quality gear, but an unsettling dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There was no group attitude,'' Bustos said. ''I was thinking, Oh, I am on my own. Everyone has to take care of himself. In my opinion, they weren't ready for such a strange and big mountain as Aconcagua.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Alfonso, despite his experience on Aconcagua, was relegated to merely a guide, someone to point the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dafoe was in charge. Petroske, his friend from Portland, was the deputy leader, followed by Eubank, the doctor, and Shelton, the interpreter for Alfonso. Then came Zeller, McMillen, Cooper and Johnson, without defined roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back then, like today, getting to the summit usually required a week or more of shuttling up and down the mountain, moving gear and adjusting to the altitude. The group carried loads to Camp 1 -- at 15,500 feet, higher than anywhere in the continental United States. They returned at day's end to base camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-altitude ups and downs were made more difficult by Aconcagua's notorious obstacle course of penitentes -- icy pillars, as tall as six feet, caused by solar radiation. They're sturdy enough that even the small ones can't be knocked over. The group called them ''white monsters.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The trek to Camp 2, at nearly 18,000 feet, took seven hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Brother was it bad,'' Cooper wrote in his diary. ''Between the ice and scree and altitude, I was done in.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He later wrote about others in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Bill Zeller is the real man behind the work,'' he said of the Oregon State Police officer, an expert in fingerprinting. ''He lugged 80 pounds up to Camp 1. Then after getting back he made the water haul -- and I'm here in the sack. I guess all do our share of work but some more than others.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson was little help, Cooper wrote. ''She is a real loner and appears to be for only one thing -- to get herself to the summit, at the expense of everyone or on everyone's back.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The expedition was fracturing from the effects of altitude. Three Americans, including Dafoe, the leader, stayed at Camp 1. Five others, including Johnson and Cooper, moved up to Camp 2 with Alfonso. Cooper felt miserable.\n",
    "\n",
    "''For 2 cents I'll go back,'' Cooper wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they plodded upward to establish Camp 3, behind an outcropping of boulders at the base of the Polish Glacier, at about 19,400 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "A storm swept through, pinning the group in place for a welcome day of rest. Behind it were clear skies, a perfect window for a climb to the summit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The group was ''expecting it to take at least all day,'' Zeller later wrote in his account of events, ''but the lower part of the glacier seemed to present no problem as it seemed to be in good condition -- no crevasses -- not too steep -- good snow for crampons etc.''\n",
    "\n",
    "But after a late breakfast, Petroske suddenly lost his coordination and struggled to put on his crampons. Others diagnosed it as a sign of high-altitude cerebral edema, a potentially deadly swelling of the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alfonso escorted Petroske back to base camp. Now the American team was cleaved in half. Gone were the expedition leader, the deputy, the doctor, the interpreter and the local guide. Remaining were Cooper, Johnson, Zeller and McMillen. None had been this high, anywhere. They barely knew one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they looked up, they saw the Polish Glacier, stretching to the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was sunny. Their jackets were unzipped. They wore crampons and carried ice axes and light packs, leaving most of their possessions behind at camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "But movement up the glacier was slow. By nightfall, the four Americans gave up on reaching the summit that day. They were at roughly 21,000 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "They dug a small snow cave on the glacier with their ice axes. They had no sleeping bags, so the climbers lay on reflective space blankets. During the night, cramped and uncomfortable, Johnson and Zeller moved outside. They sat, shivering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind blew a fine powder off the summit, filling the opening of the cave with snow and burying Cooper's legs. Johnson unburied him about an hour before sunrise.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Cooper was finished. Cold and tired, he announced that he was turning back, Zeller and McMillen later said. It was about two hours down the glacier back to Camp 3, McMillen figured. He and Zeller expressed little concern about letting Cooper go alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "''He appeared to be very capable, alert,'' Zeller later told his local newspaper. ''He had no trouble with his reasoning. There was no concern about his climbing ability, and we were not too far above high camp.''\n",
    "\n",
    "John Cooper never made it. He died on the glacier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not long after, so did Janet Johnson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rumors\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly what happened is speculation, spun around the globe for 50 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two men from Oregon -- Zeller, a police officer, and McMillen, a dairy farmer -- were the last to see Cooper and Johnson alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "They gave detailed versions of events. Slight contradictions and the confounding effect of high-altitude hallucinations raised questions for Argentine authorities and teased the public's imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Cooper headed downhill alone, Zeller, McMillen and Johnson continued up. They moved slowly. They took photographs. They reached the top of the Polish Glacier, where it meets a ridge that leads to the summit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But darkness descended again, and snow on the ridge was waist deep. The men took turns breaking the trail, 25 steps at a time. The summit in sight, the men later said, they turned to find that Johnson was not there.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We looked and looked and called her name and got no answer,'' McMillen recalled in a written account, two weeks later. ''Finally I stumbled across her ax and figured she couldn't be too far. We called some more and finally a faint little voice said, 'My name's Janet Johnson.' She was about 100 feet off our trail in the snow, laying there. When we got to her she said, 'Don't make me suffer, just let me lay here and die.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Zeller said that he roped himself to Johnson; McMillen said that Zeller ''took her by the arm.'' Zeller said that the three got lost and camped another night together; McMillen said that he went ahead of the other two and spent the night by himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their stories converged again the next morning. Johnson wouldn't stand, and her hands were ''swollen and black,'' McMillen wrote, so they ''anchored her from three different directions so we could hold her standing up'' and led her past a crevasse.\n",
    "\n",
    "They reached the snow cave where they had last seen Cooper. Some of their equipment was there, including the flare gun. McMillen said he shot it. It was 7 a.m.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It made a noise as loud as a rifle but I guess no one heard it below,'' McMillen wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson's condition seemed improved, so the men decided that McMillen should go down alone to get help, following the route that Cooper presumably took 24 hours earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "McMillen said he lost his ice ax in a steep section of the glacier and slid 1,000 feet, head first. It would account for the black eye he had later, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then he saw members of the Argentine army coming to rescue Zeller and Johnson. He heard people calling his name. He saw dead mules. And he saw a dead soldier lying in the snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only later, after reaching camp and sleeping, did it occur to him: None of that was real. The dead soldier, he learned, was John Cooper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up on the glacier, Zeller, too, was having hallucinations, not uncommon in the thin air of high altitudes. He later recalled visions of construction trucks working near the summit, and hearing phantom voices of rescuers who were never there.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Janet and I continued coming down till we were through the worst part then we took a long spill also,'' Zeller wrote in an account later that spring. ''Again doing no serious damage but breaking both of our dark glasses & cutting our faces some. We ended up 3 or 4 city blocks from camp & could see the tents.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He and Johnson came untethered in the fall, Zeller said, so he went back up to check on her. That is when he saw Cooper.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I saw John's body about halfway between us & off to the right as we faced up hill,'' Zeller wrote. ''I checked him & he was dead & appeared to be frozen -- I didn't see any cuts on his exposed skin & no tears in the clothing so assume that he didn't die as a result of a fall but exhaustion & hypothermia etc.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''Janet seemed to be OK best as I could tell so we decided that I would go ahead & set up the tent & she would follow as soon as she got her wind,'' Zeller said.\n",
    "\n",
    "He arrived at Camp 3 a couple of hours after McMillen, the men later said. They slept through the night, awoke and saw no sign of Johnson.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The next a.m. Bill and I decided to go on down,'' McMillen wrote. ''Bill was so confused he didn't know which direction to go.''\n",
    "\n",
    "He concluded: ''That's the story as near as I can recall.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions followed them downhill, like a dry, cold wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "John Shelton, the college student who served as interpreter on the climb, turned 76 this year. He had been receiving hospice care in a V.A. hospital bed in Utah for more than a year. He had a Kringle-like white beard and eyes that sparkled when he laughed.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was the last American from the expedition still alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shelton remembered getting sick from the altitude and being the first in the group to return to base camp. He kept company with Bustos, bonding over their shared affinity for science. Both were 25, the youngest in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "A day later came Eubank and Dafoe, more sick than Shelton. After another day came Petroske, with the help of Alfonso, the guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shelton described looking through binoculars at the Polish Glacier, expecting to see the remaining four climbers and spotting only three -- and, later, only two. He remembered rushing uphill with Alfonso to see whether they could help.\n",
    "\n",
    "They came upon Zeller and McMillen walking toward them. Shelton remembered the weight of the moment: Four people had gone up the glacier, but only two had returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "It did not occur to Shelton that Cooper and Johnson were anything more than victims of a high-altitude tragedy. Foul play? ''Hogwash,'' he said, 50 years later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word traveled slowly off the mountain. Families were called. Wire services and hometown newspapers wrote hasty dispatches, filling gaps with presumptions and wild falsehoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cooper's hometown in Kansas, the paper reported that he ''was presumed dead after a fall from the top of the mountain into a deep crevice during a blinding snowstorm.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires sent a memo to the U.S. secretary of state's office, trying to stanch misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Deaths did not occur as a result of a fall as reported by United Press International and Associated Press or as the result of an avalanche as reported by Reuters,'' the embassy said.\n",
    "\n",
    "News outlets in Mendoza were on the story more exhaustively and accurately. The first news was reported in Los Andes on Feb. 4: ''Fears for the Lives of Two North American Climbers,'' the headline read. There was a map of the route. Featured prominently were two smiling photos of Johnson and Cooper, taken at Hotel Nutibara two weeks earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The expedition was starting to fall apart before even the work on the ice began,'' the next day's story said, just as Americans were getting false accounts of avalanches and blinding snowstorms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the base of Aconcagua, Alfonso and the American survivors were held for questioning. In Mendoza, a judge was assigned to the case. So was a police investigator. Officials labeled the case ''averiguación de homicidio culposo'' -- investigation of manslaughter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the American government validated the suspicion. It was standard procedure for the case to remain open, the embassy wrote in its files, to ''ensure that foul play may be ruled out.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The seeds of speculation were planted.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It needs a deeper investigation,'' Los Andes wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Secret Meeting\n",
    "\n",
    "The Americans returned to Hotel Nutibara, avoiding reporters staked out in the lobby. Bustos, the base camp manager, came to say goodbye to his new American friends. They would not see him. Fifty years on, it still saddens him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. State Department didn't have much luck, either. Consul Wilbur W. Hitchcock tried to speak to the Americans during an overnight layover in Buenos Aires.\n",
    "\n",
    "''All five looked tired and somewhat dazed,'' Hitchcock wrote in a report. (The sixth survivor, Eubank, had already left the country.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dafoe cautioned Hitchcock about the effects of high altitude on mind and memory. He said that the others had experienced hallucinations and perhaps a ''feeling of unreality'' coming at such heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hitchcock returned to the airport the next morning. He spent another 30 minutes trying to question the Americans before they boarded a plane to leave Argentina.\n",
    "\n",
    "''They were unable to reconstruct the climb with sufficient accuracy,'' Hitchcock wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newspapers published a photograph from the tarmac. Shelton and Petroske smiled as McMillen appeared to say something over his shoulder. They carried packs and ice axes. A reporter asked Zeller to clarify the events on the mountain, papers reported, but Dafoe, a lawyer, stepped between them and would not let him answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all added to the intrigue in Argentina. But if any of the smoldering speculation followed the survivors back to the United States, it was quickly snuffed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Portland, the president of Mazamas wrote a secret memo. He called for a special closed meeting of club leadership and the survivors of the expedition, to be held two days later.\n",
    "\n",
    "''NONE BUT THE ABOVE-NAMED WILL BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND. The location is to be kept SECRET ... repeat ... SECRET!''\n",
    "\n",
    "The memo said that the idea was to ''learn the 'straight of things' from people involved.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''Presumably,'' it continued, ''a resultant will be the dispelling of certain suspicions, uncertainties, rumors, whatever, which may have come to your attention and have been amplified by the confused communications during the expedition and by conflicting or incomplete newspaper reports.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The meeting was held at Dafoe's law office. Two days later, on Feb. 15, Dafoe's secretary typed a three-page ''chronological summary of events.''\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the story that survivors told their hometown newspapers. And it was the basis for Dafoe's formal expedition report published in the Mazamas annual in 1973, which concluded that the deaths were an accident, that Johnson and Cooper were desperate to reach the summit, and that ''they probably died of pulmonary edema.''\n",
    "\n",
    "They did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Johnsons and the Coopers were religious Midwestern families. They trusted higher powers and government officials. They grieved but did not wallow, at least publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unclear how much they interacted, if at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coopers held a memorial service in March, but desperately wanted John's body recovered for a proper burial in Kansas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooper's father, also named John, wrote letters -- to Los Andes, to Alfonso, to the State Department -- in search of help. He learned Spanish so that he could read the news reports coming from Argentina.\n",
    "\n",
    "Janet Johnson's widowed mother, Mae Johnson, held a funeral service in April, at the Minneapolis church where her daughter played the organ as a teenager.\n",
    "\n",
    "She did not ask for her body back. She understood that her daughter had said that if anything happened to her on Aconcagua, she wanted to be buried in the little cemetery not far from the trailhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like John Cooper's father, Mae Johnson collected newspaper clippings and documents. In places where her daughter's name was spelled ''Jeannette'' by Spanish-language papers, and even by some American ones, she crossed it out and carefully wrote ''Janet.''\n",
    "\n",
    "And in places that quoted her daughter as saying, ''Let me die here,'' her mother blacked out the words so she never had to read them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Argentina, Judge Victorio Miguel Calandria Agüero wanted to know: How did John Cooper and Janet Johnson die? There could be no sure answers without the bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In late 1973, on the crest of a new summer climbing season in the Andes, a four-man team was assembled to look for them. Alfonso, wounded by criticism of his role as guide, would lead it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A National Geographic reporter and photographer named Loren McIntyre heard about this and showed up to join the team. Alfonso was glad to have him.\n",
    "\n",
    "They carried two plastic toboggans, the kind children use to sled down icy slopes, that they had reinforced with sheet metal screwed to the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "A week later, at the foot of the Polish Glacier, they found the ghostly evidence of the American expedition -- tattered tents, a torn blue sleeping bag leaking feathers.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 150 yards uphill from camp they found Cooper's frozen body.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was stretched out on relatively flat terrain, his legs extended and crossed. His hands were bare, across his abdomen. His jacket was on but his hood had fallen behind his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "''John Cooper was a tall and large man and he was frozen stiff,'' McIntyre reported to investigators. ''He was like a statue of ice and the toboggan was about half the length of his body so arranging him so that his clothes and body would not be damaged in the descent was not an easy thing and it was cold and windy and tempers were running short as we tried to get him lashed to the sled.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A storm blew in. The men left Cooper for the night, driving stakes around him to keep him in place, and descended to the safety of camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next day, McIntyre was first to the body and did a closer inspection. He took detailed photographs of Cooper and his belongings ''to make it supremely evident how he was equipped'' in case there were questions from investigators or reporters.\n",
    "\n",
    "He found Cooper's diary. He found an opened letter from Cooper's wife, Sandy. McIntyre read it aloud and translated it for the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Keep roped up, and don't forget the crampons, as I don't know how I'd replace you,'' she wrote. ''You are by far the best husband and loving one, and really good Dad, in the entire world.''\n",
    "\n",
    "There was no sign of Johnson. McIntyre combed the snowfield for several hours before giving up, he said. He considered her death the bigger mystery and thought she might have wandered off the glacier's sheer edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details about Cooper got out fast. He was missing a crampon. There was no ice ax. He was on a gentle slope. His battered face held a look of frozen terror. And his abdomen had a cylindrical hole, bloody and deep. It had gone undetected until his body thawed at a lower elevation and his frozen hands could be moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The highest percentage of possibility is that Cooper's death was an accident,'' Alfonso told reporters. But if Cooper had fallen on his own ice ax, it must have been very violent, he said, given the five layers of clothes he wore and the depth of the wound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alfonso also said that Zeller told him that he had found Cooper sitting, dead, with his head between his hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "''But the way Cooper was found reveals that Zeller's account was not exact,'' Los Andes wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "McIntyre insisted that ''there is no mystery at all.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''He fell on his ice ax and he injured himself,'' he said in a statement to investigators. ''He was in so much discomfort and pain when he was nearly to base camp that when he finally got off the steep part of the glacier, got down on the flat, he had evidently stopped, sat down and removed his gloves and was probably trying to examine himself and his wound when he fell unconscious and froze to death.''\n",
    "\n",
    "McIntyre left a sliver of doubt. In a 1974 letter to Sandy Cooper, he suggested that McMillen and Zeller ''have probably formed some conclusions in their own minds which may be true or which may be an adjustment with conscience they can live with.'' He continued, ''I wonder whether you have ever talked with them?''\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unclear if the Cooper or Johnson families ever did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooper's body, per the family's wishes, was transported to Kansas. It arrived in a metal coffin, shipped inside a plain wooden crate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coffin was buried in the cold December ground in El Dorado. The empty crate sat for decades in the garage of Cooper's parents, who couldn't part with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the full autopsy were sealed by the judge. But he released the cover page, which noted the cause of death.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not exposure, not pulmonary edema, not even the mysterious wound to the abdomen that plunged through five layers of clothes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causa de la defunción: Contusión cráneo encefálica.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cause of death: Cranial contusions. Injuries to the skull and brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The judge made only one declaration: We need Janet Johnson's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Janet Johnson\n",
    "\n",
    "Alberto Colombero was 17 when he and two others found Johnson's body. He keeps the photos from that day in a small box.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was Feb. 9, 1975. Colombero was climbing Aconcagua with his father, Ernesto, and Guillermo Vieiro, both experienced Aconcagua climbers, now both deceased. A storm forced them to abort a summit attempt. The three decided to come down the Polish Glacier. They knew the story well. They knew Johnson's body might be somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colombero saw something reddish to his left. It was obscured by knee-high penitentes, the ice pillars characteristic of Aconcagua, and partially covered in fresh snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The men thought it was a tarp, a tent, maybe a backpack.\n",
    "\n",
    "They found Johnson face up. Her face, blackened from two years of exposure, was battered in three places. White bone stuck out of her nose, her forehead and her chin, where skin hung down like a flap. There were blood stains on her face and jacket.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crampon was missing from one foot. Ropes were tangled around her. Her hands were bare, her light jacket unzipped. They could not find her ice ax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope was shallow. Didn't Zeller say that he and Johnson had a long fall together? There was no way this was where they fell, they thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colombero's memory holds one other striking detail: a rock sitting on top of Johnson. Her body was in a field of ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colombero said that he was too young and inexperienced at the time to draw conclusions. But the older men, for the rest of their lives, were sure Johnson was murdered, Colombero said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''They thought everything was planned,'' he added. ''That it wasn't an accident, that someone had hit her and tried to make it look like she rolled down the hill in exhaustion.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Their discovery and version of events were soon highlighted in the Mendoza newspapers, along with gruesome photos they took. Johnson's body was just 20 meters from where Cooper's body had been found, the reports said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three men were unprepared to bring Johnson's body down. So they dug it out and shifted it so that a future recovery expedition would see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "They found a ring with a cloudy brown stone on Johnson's finger. They removed it and passed it to an American climber named Allen Steck, who happened to be on the mountain at the same time. In April 1975, he sent it to Abrahamson, Johnson's sister.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I am enclosing the ring that Janet was wearing when we examined her,'' he wrote. ''We did not find anything of her equipment or her camera (assuming she had one).''\n",
    "\n",
    "The ring is the only possession from the trip that Johnson's family received for 50 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In February 1976, William Montalbano, the Latin America correspondent for The Miami Herald, wrote two articles about the deadly mysteries of Aconcagua.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second focused on plans for the recovery of Johnson's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "''How Did Janet Johnson Really Die?'' the headline read.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There is sufficient mystery and enough unanswered questions surrounding the death of Janet Johnson and NASA engineer John Cooper on the same 1973 expedition to have raised the suspicion of foul play,'' Montalbano wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article focused on Ramón Arrieta Cortez, the lead investigator, who ''must establish if Aconcagua killed Janet Johnson or if she was murdered,'' Montalbano wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after, a team of men, mostly police officers in Mendoza with climbing experience, found Johnson's body. Her face was darker, far more mummified than a year earlier, because of recent exposure to sun and wind. They found no other belongings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The men struggled to extricate Johnson from the ice. They crudely sliced her left arm at the shoulder and left it, with a broken watch still on her wrist.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We had to dig the ice to get her unfrozen from the glacier,'' said Rudy Parra, one of the men, now a retired police officer. ''It was like taking a piece of the glacier off the mountain.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The room where the Cooper and Johnson autopsies were performed in Mendoza is still in use today. It sits in a worn, one-story stucco building that looks like a barrack. It is equipped with stainless steel tables, electric tools that hang from the ceiling and concrete floors that slope to drains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daniel Araujo was a medical student and an assistant to the medical examiner, Dr. Carlos DeCicco, on the Cooper and Johnson autopsies. Today he is a neurosurgeon in Mendoza.\n",
    "\n",
    "He still remembers Cooper because of the skull fracture and, especially, the tubular hole to his abdomen. It was like a bullet hole, perfectly round. The wound was so deep that it reached all the way to Cooper's spine. Araujo always suspected an ice screw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson's autopsy stands out because of the damage to her face -- bone exposed in three places. Araujo recalled deep cuts on her boot that made him think someone had taken some hard whacks at her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson's autopsy report, with photos, was submitted to the judge. Like Cooper, she officially died of contusión cráneo encefálica. A brain injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "Araujo has been haunted by the memory of those autopsies for most of his life.\n",
    "\n",
    "''They were killed,'' he said. ''Both of them. These kinds of injuries were not self-inflicted.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Was that the consensus of the examiners in the room?\n",
    "\n",
    "''Yes,'' he said. ''No doubt about it.''\n",
    "\n",
    "News media coverage did not go that far. In ''forensic circles,'' Los Andes reported, ''it appeared to be a crime, though the police had not made any accusations.'' It left the case open for public interpretation yet again.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Were the wounds to the head from a fall or deliberate?'' Los Andes asked. ''Perhaps the truth will never be known.''\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where any serious consideration ended. On March 24, 1976, Argentina's government under Isabel Perón fell to a deadly military coup. Argentina was turned inside out, and tens of thousands are thought to have died in the seven-year upheaval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any formal investigation into the American expedition was handed over to the collective imagination. The mystery seemed to freeze in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Days before the coup, the body of Johnson was buried in a small mountaineer's cemetery near the trailheads to Aconcagua. No one from her family came. But a flower bouquet rested on her coffin. ''De Tu Madre,'' it read -- From Your Mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the two dozen witnesses were members of the police group that recovered her body, including Arrieta Cortez, the lead investigator. (According to his son, Juan, Arrieta Cortez died in 2017 and never reached a conclusion in the case.)\n",
    "\n",
    "''Under the sky of America, we bury a daughter here on Argentine soil,'' Arrieta Cortez said at the graveyard gathering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representatives from the American embassy had made the 650-mile trip from Buenos Aires. The ceremony took 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I wish to inform you that your daughter, Janet Johnson, was buried on March 19, 1976, pursuant to your request, at the Mountain Climber's Cemetery at Punta del Inca,'' the embassy wrote to Johnson's mother. ''Funeral services at the gravesite were very dignified and impressive.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A man arrived late, rushing to the service just as it ended. It was Miguel Alfonso, the guide, there to pay his last respects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Camera\n",
    "\n",
    "For nearly 50 years, a Nikomat camera, carried by an American woman, sat frozen in a high-altitude time capsule. But it was not frozen in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the camera was dropped may not be where it was found. The Polish Glacier has been shrinking and shifting, cracking and moving downhill by the pull of gravity and with the change of seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "And on a sunny day in February 2020, the heart of the Argentine summer, the camera sat on a stocky penitente, like a museum piece on a pedestal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was Marcos Calamaro, a young porter, who brought it down to camp. It was Ulises Corvalán, the experienced guide, who recognized the name stamped on the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the camp that day was a photographer named Pablo Betancourt. He recognized that the film inside might be evidence to be preserved, as it had been for most of five decades. He put the camera into a case and stuffed it with snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "He contacted The New York Times, wondering whether such a discovery might be of interest. And he wondered what else the melting glacier might be revealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson's arm was found, in a red jacket sleeve, near the glacier's edge. Then her knapsack, filled with gear and two more aluminum canisters, with film inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Oregon, Johnson's only surviving immediate family member got a surprise call, sharing the news of the discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abrahamson's response was clear. Yes, develop the film. Find out everything you can. Please.\n",
    "\n",
    "''She's still my sister,'' she said. ''I still want to know what really happened to her.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Indian Head, Saskatchewan, is about an hour east of Regina. Its tallest structure is a grain elevator. There is not a mountain in sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a downtown corner is a former bank, a two-story brick structure from the 1800s. Today it is home to Film Rescue International, run by a man named Greg Miller.\n",
    "\n",
    "His small team of technicians receive and process old or damaged undeveloped film from all over the world -- rolls abandoned in attics, reels discovered in shipwrecks, the forgotten Instamatic found with film inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Miller was holding a camera that had been locked in a glacier at roughly 20,000 feet for almost five decades. The camera was intact; the only crack was inside the lens. The mechanisms worked. The leather holster screwed to the camera bottom had probably protected it from leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that a glacier on Aconcagua is not a bad place to preserve film. Humidity is always a detriment, but the Andes are notably dry. High-altitude radiation can be a concern, but the camera had been entombed in ice. Cold temperatures are much better for film than hot ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Miller took the camera into a dark room, flicked on an infrared light that would not expose the film and clicked the back of the camera open.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think we're going to see something,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing responsibility fell to Erik LaBossiere, a 35-year-old part-time pro wrestler and metal-band guitarist with a bald head, a soft voice and arms covered in tattoos.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was nervous. There was only one chance to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under infrared light, LaBossiere moved the rolls of film into lightproof drums. The drums went into a machine that washed the film in a cycle of solutions, precisely timed -- an automated version of the dunk-and-soak method from old photographic development. When LaBossiere emerged from the dark room, he seemed pleased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Had he not known the origin of the film -- trapped on a glacier in Argentina for decades -- LaBossiere ''would have assumed it was on a shelf somewhere,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "After more machines and more solutions, LaBossiere unspooled the film and held a strip to the light.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Yeah,'' he said. ''Mountains and people.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson was a good photographer. The photos are beautiful, haunting, marred only by streaks of moisture that color the frames, some more than others. They turn ordinary landscapes into something closer to art.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the rolls was unused. Johnson had carried it toward the summit with the apparent expectation that she would need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, found in a canister, had 36 exposures. The first frame was shot from a valley just short of base camp, an ethereal image of snow-covered mountains. Then came lots of penitentes and snow-covered peaks. They chronicle the expedition's up-and-down method of moving from one camp to another, acclimatizing and hauling gear.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one photo of Johnson, having handed her camera to someone else. She is smiling, wearing a floppy hat and heavy-duty aluminum-framed glacier glasses. She has an ice ax in her right hand and an overstuffed pack on her back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The roll found inside the camera had 24 photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seventh photo was taken near camp at the foot of the Polish Glacier. Only Johnson, Cooper, Zeller and McMillen went higher than that. Johnson snapped pictures from the glacier. Footprints dent the soft snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around midday, the sun high and the shadows short, Johnson took a photo of one of the other climbers, who was downhill and sitting on the glacier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afternoon shadows got longer with each photograph. Soon the four climbers would dig a cave to sleep in. Cooper would head downhill the next morning while the other three continued up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson took more photos after Cooper was gone. The 21st photograph showed either Zeller or McMillen climbing ahead of her, into the afternoon sun, each step making deep holes in the snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Published in the Mazamas annual later that year is the opposite photograph, taken by Zeller -- downhill, of Johnson hiking up on the summit ridge, at about 22,000 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson wore her floppy hat. Her coat was unzipped and her mittens dangled from strings at her sleeves. She held her ice ax in her right hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before dark, Johnson snapped three more photographs of the surrounding Andes. If she was oxygen-deprived or delirious, she still knew how to focus the lens, compose the frame and hold the camera steady to take clear photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where the film ends. That is where the legend begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The film does not solve the mystery. It adds to it. It tells you what Johnson saw in her final hours, but not how she felt. Not how she died.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every discovery leads to revelation. Some just make you want to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mystery\n",
    "\n",
    "If Janet Johnson and John Cooper were still alive, they would be in their late 80s.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the Americans from the expedition to Aconcagua are gone. Dafoe, the leader, died in a car crash on a rural Montana highway in 1975. Zeller died in 2003, McMillen in 2011. Shelton died in November, leaving behind a collection of old photos, Mazamas memos and newspaper files.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It remains the greatest mystery of Aconcagua,'' said Morán, the Argentine journalist who covered the expedition and its aftermath. He is 80 now. ''This story had nearly faded from popular memory, but there are enough reasons for doubts and arguments to make the mystery persist.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Folklore happens when facts are short and time is long. After all these years, this story is not about long-gone Americans on the mountain, but the unknown that lives in those who remain. It is less about certainty than memory and imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question arises again and again among those familiar with the story: Just what are the possibilities? An ''accident'' is a tidy catchall, a useful way to move on. What if it was something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "Corvalán, a dean of Aconcagua guides, with 59 successful summits, first heard the stories from old-timers when he began climbing the mountain 35 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were theories and embellishments, dots connected with fuzzy lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "A love triangle gone wrong. A stash of money that was never found. Cooper as a government agent. Assassins who crossed the nearby Chilean border. Is that why Loren McIntyre, an American, had shown up, as if from thin air, to find the bodies? Why was he taking so many photographs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Corvalán studied Johnson's photos from 1973. He noted the shallow slope and the uncharacteristically soft snow on the Polish Glacier that year. A long fall and a deadly slide down the ice were improbable, maybe impossible, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "But something else bothered Corvalán. He has seen bodies ravaged by even short falls. Bones are broken. Clothing and equipment are shredded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, Corvalán wondered, did so little of that appear to have happened to Johnson and Cooper? Why was the damage confined mostly to their faces?\n",
    "\n",
    "Corvalán thought about it. He is a mountaineer. He has been atop the Seven Summits. He knows what experience and common sense tell him: an accident. But more than before, Corvalán believes that -- maybe -- there was foul play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foul play. It is a persistent, vague euphemism in this story. Negligence? Manslaughter? Worse? How? Why? Is it even possible at such an altitude, with such fatigue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Corvalán shrugged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roberto Bustos, the base camp manager, is now 76. He has a file of yellowed clippings and photos at home. He has a rope that belonged to Shelton that he holds as a treasured memento.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johnson's newly developed pictures stir memories but do not change his mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "He sees what happened to Johnson and Cooper as ''a mountain accident,'' he said, but he does not dismiss the possibility of something violent. Norms shift at high altitudes, he said. Desperation toys with right and wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that has not changed in 50 years, on mountains from Aconcagua to Everest, is the notion of ethics and responsibility. They get squishy at high altitudes, amid the dangers and limits of the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's a different world at 6,000 meters, with different laws and rules,'' Bustos said. ''And the behavior -- you would go down to 5,000 meters and think these people are crazy.''\n",
    "\n",
    "If their climbing partners did all they reasonably could to help Cooper and Johnson, wasn't that enough? If they abandoned their colleagues to save themselves, or somehow did harm to them, could they be blamed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Zeller's widow, in her 90s, said through her son that she did not want to talk about the expedition and requested no further contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "''As a state policeman, he is precise, exacting and careful,'' the local newspaper wrote of Zeller in 1973. ''When he speaks he says only what needs to be said. There are mysteries of the mountain he cannot explain. He is not used to that.''\n",
    "\n",
    "McMillen's family said that he continued to climb mountains for the rest of his life, including Denali twice, even after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He had more than 100 dairy cows, and would give slide presentations of his climbs to friends and family in the barn.\n",
    "\n",
    "His children recall McMillen talking about how he and others were held and questioned in Argentina because of the deaths. They know little about any speculation of foul play, of the stories spun in Argentina. It seems impossible to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Judge Victorio Miguel Calandria Agüero never made a ruling in the case. Shortly before he died in 2022, he was asked about the American expedition by a local journalist, who said that readers had followed the coverage ''like a novel'' and raised the specter of murder.\n",
    "\n",
    "''None of that was ever proven,'' the judge said.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, from the ice, came Johnson's camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "And whatever ghosts had been laid to rest were stirred back up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Oregon City, Ore., Judie Abrahamson had not gone through her sister's belongings for years. They were stashed under the house, ignored if not forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of it made a lot of sense -- these slides of mountain landscapes and strangers in climbing gear, those yellowing newspaper clippings in Spanish where her mother crossed out every suggestion that her daughter ever wanted to die alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Abrahamson, Janet Johnson was not an accomplished climber in Colorado or the haunting name that echoes in the Andes. She was not a someone else's legend or anybody else's mystery.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was Janet, a brainy 10-year-old who asked for a little sister and welcomed her to the family with a doll. She was an overachiever who grew into a woman that her mother could not understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was just a big sister, Aunt Janet to Abrahamson's kids, who set out to prove that she could do anything she wanted, even climb the highest mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abrahamson thinks about her sister and wonders how she might have grown old, might have climbed more mountains, might have come out, might have felt ... accepted, even celebrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kansas, Joy Cooper is nearly 90, the older sister who remembers John Cooper as a little boy with so much wanderlust that their father had to build a fence to keep him in.\n",
    "\n",
    "She remembers when people filled the church for his funeral, and they buried her little brother in the cemetery right after Christmas. Her parents were never quite the same after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Texas, Randy Cooper, son of a NASA engineer, raised by a widowed mother who has since died, does not remember much of anything about his father. But he has been told that they share some of the same mannerisms, like the way they pop their knuckles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Randy got older, he decided to go by his first name: John. And when people asked about his father, he would tell them the only thing he really knew: My dad died mountain climbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Johnson and Cooper families never learned much about what happened on Aconcagua. They just knew that things went wrong, and that Janet and John were gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details -- the newspaper stories, the letters, the official documents, all the questions and regrets -- were swallowed up by sadness, then by time.\n",
    "\n",

    "Paul Thomas Murphy's ''Falling Rocket'' focuses on the explosive trial that divided the London art world.\n",
    "\n",
    "FALLING ROCKET: James Whistler, John Ruskin, and the Battle for Modern Art, by Paul Thomas Murphy\n",
    "\n",
    "''I have seen, and heard, much of Cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask 200 guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.'' These words by John Ruskin, Victorian England's pre-eminent critic, were written in 1877 about ''Nocturne in Black and Gold -- The Falling Rocket,'' a painting by James Abbott McNeill Whistler, the most flamboyant artist of that era.\n",
    "\n",
    "And they resulted in the most notorious trial in the history of art when Whistler decided to take the shocking step of suing the writer for his review -- as much for the publicity as for the thousand guineas in damages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both artist and critic were already very famous; Whistler, the American-born dandy, aesthete and provocateur, made a compelling contrast to Ruskin, who for decades had served as moralistic defender of a spiritual gravitas rooted in the Middle Ages. The painting that so inspired Ruskin's ire supposedly conjured a fireworks display, though -- as the darkest and moodiest of Whistler's ''nocturnes'' -- it was as close to pure abstraction as art had yet ventured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whistler had first exhibited the shocking oil at London's Grosvenor Gallery ; Ruskin's scathing review initially appeared in the July, 1877 edition of his newsletter, Fors Clavigera. The art world was agog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whistler saw this as a chance to gain some much-needed funds and to publicly state his views on art in opposition to the most celebrated cultural theorist of the time. But Ruskin himself never took the dock, incapacitated as he was by a series of breakdowns, and he instead had Edward Burne-Jones, the Pre-Raphaelite painter, testify on his behalf. The November 1878 trial lasted only two days, but it was an immediate cause célèbre in the international press.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whistler was in magnificent form, his flow of witty remarks greeted with applause. On revealing that his painting had taken just two days to complete, Whistler was asked if it was not presumptuous to price it at 200 guineas. ''No,'' Whistler responded, ''it was for the knowledge gained through a lifetime.''\n",
    "\n",
    "His braggadocio paid off -- barely. In the end, though Whistler technically won the case, the jury awarded him a mere farthing -- a comically tiny amount that made clear they were equally sympathetic to Ruskin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whistler, however, proudly played it as a total victory, and wore the farthing on a watch chain, often restaging his courtroom triumph for friends -- and he certainly went on to ever-increasing fame and success, the avant-garde minimalism of his work eventually finding its time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ruskin felt insulted and legally fettered by the verdict. Even a public subscription to cover his legal costs did not allay the deeper gloom that already owned him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often mistakenly read as a clear victory for new art over reactionary criticism, this trial was also a notable precursor to many a modern battle, both in court and in the mass media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trial set a precedent for the attempt to sue critics for negative opinions, helping create the world in which many of us live today.After Whistler v. Ruskin, probably the most contentious such case was when Dan Moldea, inflamed by a review of his book, sued for $10 million in punitive damages, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court; the publication in question was The New York Times Book Review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such precedents shall surely temper any criticism of the current volume by Paul Thomas Murphy, entirely enjoyable in its breezy enthusiasm, but possibly not needed at all. The jacket flap may proclaim this an ''untold story,'' but the exemplary bibliography makes clear how much has already been written on this subject, often with either considerably more poetry or academic rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is an unashamedly approachable ''good read'' (as befits an author with several advanced degrees in Victorian studies), with only the slightest whiff of the cut-and-paste potboiler, deploying the sort of prose in which a painting is described as ''a stunner'' and declaring that Gandhi read Ruskin with ''earth-shattering consequences.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most topical subtext of this book is one of Blackness -- both political and pictorial. The word ''black'' is omnipresent throughout the narrative; for Whistler it was the ''universal harmonizer'' at the core of his practice, a color that he loved -- in paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a subtext, the American Civil Warshadows Whistler's story: His brother was a Confederate soldier and spy; he himself knew the family of Robert E. Lee. Infamously, Whistler himself once nicknamed a Haitian ''the Marquis of Marmalade,'' slapped an abolitionist who objected to his rhetoric and served guests ''Crème Oncle Tom.''\n",
    "\n",
    "For Ruskin, the color was a state of mind symbolized in ''black blight'' weather. If Whistler seems the more contemporary of the two, not least because of his gift for self-promotional outrage, it is worth remembering that the gloomy Ruskin was the most unexpectedly prescient. It was in 1875 that he warned of ''some terrible change of climate coming upon the world for its sin, like another deluge.''\n",

    "In ''Welcome Home, Stranger,'' Kate Christensen takes readers inside the best kind of fictional family: a dysfunctional one.\n",
    "\n",
    "WELCOME HOME, STRANGER, by Kate Christensen\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first sentence of Kate Christensen's unflinching eighth novel, ''Welcome Home, Stranger,'' the reader learns that Rachel Calloway's mother has died -- and she does what most people do when a parent passes away: ''You get on a plane and go home.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Rachel, an award-winning climate-change journalist, barely manages to collect herself for a flight bound for Portland, Maine. ''My jeans are flecked with lint, my eyes are gritty, my teeth skuzzy, my hair a cloud of chaos,'' she says. ''I look and feel exactly like what I am: a middle-aged childless recently orphaned menopausal workaholic journalist.'' As it turns out, Rachel hasn't returned home in almost a decade after a falling-out with her negligent, alcoholic mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christensen's use of present tense brings an immediacy and urgency to her storytelling, with the reader riding shotgun as Rachel tumbles headlong into the chaos of her life, past and present. In contrast, her privileged younger sister lives a life of shiny domestic perfection (or so it seems). Celeste, who nursed their mother through her illness, ferries her teenage twins around in a Mercedes SUV while her wealthy husband, a wannabe playwright, sips one glass of wine after another. ''This is my family. These are my people,'' Rachel tells us. ''It's not easy to come back here, not easy to find my place again, like a book I abandoned midway through and lost the thread of.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the spotlight on midlife, one might describe ''Welcome Home, Stranger'' as a menopause novel, comparable to Dana Spiotta's ''Wayward,'' which tells the story of Samantha Raymond, a 53-year-old woman looking for meaning amid the turmoil following the 2016 election. Indeed, our shelves could use more women like Rachel and Sam as a counterpoint to men in midlife who've dominated fiction for decades -- Richard Ford's Frank Bascombe, John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom, Saul Bellow's Moses Herzog, among others. It's exhilarating to read an uninhibited female character who is rife with contradictions. Passive and full of agency. Thoughtful and self-centered. Calculated and impulsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's a weird age, isn't it?'' Rachel asks her high school nemesis. ''I can feel myself becoming invisible. It's a diminishment and a superpower at the same time.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Christensen also does a skillful job of animating difficult family relationships while avoiding a conventional arc of forgiveness. When Rachel returns to the land of her childhood, the compass of her former self often doesn't lead her in the right direction: Her old boyfriend has married her sister's best friend and let's just say, some passionate antics ensue. Later, Rachel recruits a homeless veteran to help renovate the townhouse she's inherited from her mother; once again, complications arise. All the while, Rachel is attempting to make sense of the strained relationship she had with her mother. As a middle-aged, childless woman who lost both parents not too long ago, I appreciate Christensen's efforts to explore this gray territory of intimacy and estrangement. It's not an easy story to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, ''Welcome Home, Stranger'' doesn't always deliver. Driven by Rachel's over-analytical first-person voice, the narrative -- as well as the dialogue -- is frequently freighted with exposition, which, in turn, sometimes flattens the reckless spirit of the novel. A subplot related to the narrator's own patterns of drinking and abstinence doesn't quite track, and a pileup of convenient plot turns gave me a bit of whiplash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these choices underscore reality: When a neglectful parent dies, a seamless, well-choreographed narrative rarely follows. Christensen doesn't shy away from this ugliness and all that goes with it. At the same time, she attempts to seek some measure of peace and resolution for Rachel, who eventually loses everything before she begins to see the present and the past with more clarity. In one of the closing scenes, our protagonist wanders into the woods of the family's camp in northern rural Maine. ''There's the low murmur of moving water, sleepy bedtime discussions among the birds, a rustling as nocturnal animals emerge, the warm low-lying daytime air lifting with a great collective sough into the cooling sky,'' writes Christensen. ''I feel a chill on the back of my neck.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, it is surprising to see where Rachel meets herself. Despite relentless challenges, she manages to find her own footing, so to speak, on her home turf and discovers a new place for herself at the same time.\n",

    "In ''Most Delicious Poison,'' Noah Whiteman explores nature's fine line between killing and curing.\n",
    "\n",
    "MOST DELICIOUS POISON: The Story of Nature's Toxins -- From Spices to Vices, by Noah Whiteman\n",
    "\n",
    "What doesn't kill you might make you stronger. When it comes to nature's toxins, they might even save your life (or at least blunt the sting of its finality). The distinction, as the evolutionary biologist Noah Whiteman explores in ''Most Delicious Poison,'' is all in the dosage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take alcohol. Ethanol is likely born of plants' evolutionary search for protection. Long before the first happy hour, yeast's alcohol-making evolved as a means for the fungi residing in rotting fruit to survive oxygen deprivation. Ethanol thwarts most microbes; but yeast thrives, burning energy from sugar in oxygen's absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same ethanol that might jump-start a party can, through addiction, mean the destruction of the liver -- not to mention lives. Alcohol's paradox, Whiteman writes, is tied to ethanol's ability to mimic (or possibly bind to) gamma-aminobutyric acid -- that is, the neurotransmitter our brains use to soften the nervous system's activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating to human terms, Whiteman explains, ''Drinking relieved my father of serious nerve pain he suffered from a motorcycle accident before I was born.'' Alcohol addiction ultimately killed Whiteman's father, an amateur naturalist who taught his son to take comfort in the natural world while fighting off the pain in his own life.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of ''Most Delicious Poison'' is an evolutionary oxymoron that sustains life as we know it: Poisons -- in deserts or rainforests, at the corner bar or in your fridge -- threaten life while offering possibilities for persistence, and the pleasures that we take from substances that would otherwise be deadly hint at the ways life on earth manages to thrive in a landscape of toxins. And in the author's case, the question clearly has personal meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Scratch beneath the surface of a coffee bean, a red pepper flake, a poppy capsule, a Penicillium mold, a foxglove leaf, a magic mushroom, a marijuana bud, a nutmeg seed or a brewer's yeast cell, and we find a bevy of poisons,'' Whiteman writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caffeine is another natural wonder best approached with caution. ''Caffeine and the human mind,'' says Whiteman, can seem like a match made in heaven. ''Taken in the appropriate doses, caffeine not only feels life-giving but is: Drink a few cups a day and you won't live forever but a little longer.'' Whiteman sorts through data suggesting as much, though, anecdotally, on a fall morning in the dark, it sure feels true.\n",
    "\n",
    "But caffeine can be deadly. In October of this year, the parents of a University of Pennsylvania student with a congenital heart condition sued Panera Bread over their ''Charged Lemonade,'' on the grounds that a substance containing three Red Bulls' worth of caffeine should have been marketed as an energy drink, potentially saving their daughter's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet used in moderation, the poison that we drink in pumpkin spice lattes blocks adenosine receptors -- adenosine being a brain-produced neurotransmitter that would otherwise encourage you to rest. Why does caffeine do this? Whiteman points to honeybees, which, in dark hives, share directions in what the neuroethologist Karl von Frisch described in the 1970s as something like GPS translated with gyrations. Plants that have evolved to synthesize caffeine, goes one theory, might offer it to their pollinators, theoretically rendering the bees more flight aware and thus more productive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or did plants first develop this wondrous crystalline compound as a potent insecticide? Did its presence in the coffee plant signal stress, as do the salicylic acids that close a plant's pores, shutting the gate on microbial invasion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whiteman's fieldwork has taken him to the Galápagos, where he studied the DNA of lice on hawks; to Colorado, where today he looks for the genetic and molecular traces of adaptations that result from interactions between species. He is based at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is professor of integrative biology and molecular and cell biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Most Delicious Poison'' is most delicious for its scope: from birds' judicious digestion of toxic butterflies to the repugnance of rats to the smell of death -- rats bury dead rats, in captivity. We see the pathways that relate the piperine in black pepper to Demerol and opioids, and Whiteman tells us that the Alpha-pinene that makes balsam fir smell lovely for forest bathers once killed a man delivering a tanker of it when, without a respirator, he cleaned out the inside of his truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need a degree in neurophysiology to enjoy the book -- though I imagine it would add to the experience, which can at times feel like a riveting lecture by a passionate professor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the granular approach, the book's concerns are universal. ''Two of the unintended consequences of the obsession and need for natural toxins are the global biodiversity crisis and the global climate crisis,'' Whiteman writes in summation. ''These twin problems threaten not only our survival as a species but also that of the biosphere itself.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Pharma's relationship to Indigenous knowledge is a recurring motif. ''Indigenous healers have yielded nearly 50 percent of all modern drugs we use today,'' writes Whiteman. Western medicine, in his telling, is still playing catch-up, even as this same society devours the lands that are the last strongholds of the very biodiversity that heals.\n",
    "\n",
    "But ultimately, however important his larger conclusions, Whiteman's project is a personal one. In its exploration of the brain's mesolimbic reward system that taunted his father, the book serves as a love letter to a man whose addictions made him a poisonous parent during what Whiteman calls a ''long struggle with nature's toxins.''\n",

    "4 p.m. | Hike to rock carvings\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a common misconception that the desert is dry and dead. Hiking the Barker Dam Trail, a mostly flat one-mile loop in Joshua Tree National Park, dispels this myth as you encounter ground squirrels and fruiting cactuses. Plaques teach you about edible resources, like acorns from the turbinella oak trees, and natural wonders like the cheesebush, which smells like -- you guessed it -- cheese. Rock carvings, believed to have been created by the Maara'yam, or Serrano people, centuries ago (although they have since been vandalized), are a reminder of how this area has given life to humans for at least 5,000 years. There isn't cell reception in the park, so grab a paper map with your park pass ($30 for seven days). The trailhead has parking and is a 13-mile drive from the western park entrance, just south of the Joshua Tree community.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 p.m. | Listen to live music\n",
    "\n",
    "The high desert attracts all sorts of artists and visionaries. The artist and composer Lou Harrison, known for his mastery of non-Western and experimental music, helped found a performance space and residency for artists in Joshua Tree before he died in 2003. Today, Lou Harrison House hosts ecology programs in its garden and live music (sliding-scale tickets, from $25) in its vaulted concert hall, whose enchantingly warm acoustics are a result of its unusual construction. Inside the building's stucco walls are straw bales, a material championed for its sustainability by Harrison and the artistic community who built the house. If you're hungry after an evening of music, head to Snakebite Roadhouse, an eclectic new diner and bar in Yucca Valley that is decorated with full-size motorcycles inside, for vegan tacos ($13).\n",

    "11 a.m. | Gaze at mountains\n",
    "\n",
    "When Nikki Hill and Claire Wadsworth converted an old diner into the California food mecca La Copine in 2015, they kept the original kitchen's equipment. The well-seasoned griddle inspired the addition of a Spanish dish called socarrat ($23), which refers to the deliciously crunchy bits at the bottom of paella (here, it's served with pea shoots and basil oil). The menu features exceptionally fresh food and changes two or three times a year; currently you might find a wintry sweet-potato-and-miso soup ($12) or a Wagyu steak sandwich with horseradish cream ($24). The interior features whimsical murals by the artist Kris Chau, and large windows reveal a panoramic view of glowing blue mountains. La Copine is open only Thursday to Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., so plan accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 p.m. | Explore art made of junk\n",
    "\n",
    "Artworks in the Noah Purifoy Outdoor Desert Art Museum of Assemblage Sculpture have their own rules of logic: There's a gravity-defying arch of toilets, totemic stacks of bowling balls and suspended bicycles that resemble the scales of justice. Purifoy, an Alabama native who lived mostly in Los Angeles and Joshua Tree before his death in 2004, was known for his large-scale assemblages made from discarded materials. Visitors can wander among more than 100 installations and sculptures at the artist's former 10-acre residence. Purifoy's early works, one of which is here, used charred debris gathered from the 1965 Watts rebellion, a series of uprisings in response to the violent arrest of a Black man in Los Angeles. Pieces like ''Carousel,'' which looks like a homemade space station made of toasters, skis and computers, make the capacity of Purifoy's imagination to create such evocative sculptures from junk seem infinite. Entry is free; donations are welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3:30 p.m. | Capture desert scents\n",
    "\n",
    "In the center of Joshua Tree, a sensorial heaven awaits in an unassuming shopping center. Pull up a seat at Grateful Desert Apothecary's recently remodeled aromatherapy bar, with shelves full of herbs and tinctures in glass bottles, where a staff member will help you create your own natural perfume. Arrive with an idea or purpose to avoid being overwhelmed by the library of more than 80 ingredients. Perhaps you'll be inspired by local scents, like the smell of creosote bushes, which have an earthy brightness after a light rain. Once you've chosen your blend, name your fragrance and the apothecary will store the recipe in an archive in case you want it again. Pricing varies depending on the ingredients, but is surprisingly affordable at around $15 to $20 for a small roll-on vial.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 p.m. | Eat gumbo in an oasis\n",
    "\n",
    "Dining outdoors in the high desert is always romantic, as the absence of light pollution assures you'll be blanketed under starry skies. Kitchen in the Desert, right off the main highway in Twentynine Palms, has sprawling open-air seating and a staggering amount of cactus, creating the effect of an oasis. The Caribbean-leaning dishes are packed with flavor, without being overly complicated. Coconut rice adds a rich layer to a gumbo topped with juicy shrimp and sausage ($23), while the shiitake mushrooms are seasoned with lemon zest and yellow miso ($19), a refreshing mix after a long day in a dry climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "9 p.m. | Sip mezcal, shoot pool\n",
    "\n",
    "End your evening with some cozy fun at Out There Bar, an artsy dive with magic hiding in its corners. There's a photo booth that claims to be a time portal, tinsel around the bar, and games of pool and shuffleboard often played by customers wearing cowboy apparel. The cocktails ($12 to $14), heavy on the tequila and mezcal, are best enjoyed on the patio. Out There Bar hosts all sorts of events, including dance parties, pizza nights, drag bingo, chef pop-ups and tarot readings. There's no regular program, so you'll have to embrace happenstance or check out the bar's Instagram stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sunday\n",
    "\n",
    "7 a.m. | Go back to the Old West\n",
    "\n",
    "California's high-desert scenery often feels like the backdrop of an old western (in Pioneertown, northwest of the park, a set used for many films of the western genre still stands). For the nonfiction version of Wild West-like drama, enter the park via the west entrance and hike to the site of a showdown near the Wall Street Mill, once used to process gold mined in the area. In 1943, two neighbors entered into a fatal duel over a property line disagreement along what's now the trail. On the path, a sign commemorating the shootout reads, ''Here is where Worth Bagley bit the dust at the hand of W.F. Keys.'' The sign is a replica of the original one that Keys, the mill's owner, made and installed himself. At the end of the path, you'll reach the ruins of the mill, flanked by rusted-out antique cars. The relatively easy hourlong round-trip feels like traveling back in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "10 a.m. | Hop on a horse\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there anything quite as majestic as riding a horse through a desert expanse? The United States has an overpopulation crisis of mustangs, and Cascade Trails Mustang Sanctuary, which opened in 2020 in Joshua Tree, is a haven for around 20 displaced horses in need of care, as well as for the humans who love them. Choose from a range of close-up equine experiences: Meet the horses ($45, one hour), learn to ride them (from $100, one hour) or take one out on a trail ($180, one hour). The trail ride crosses flat, undeveloped land where you may be lucky enough to see a rare desert tortoise. Your guide will share riding tips and the often dramatic back stories of the rescue animals on the ranch. There are also glamping-style stays, including in a geodesic dome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noon | Relax with a cold brew\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe it's the influence of the billion-year-old rocks in the region, but time feels much slower in the desert, even while caffeinated. The coffee shop Más o Menos can feel like a temple for relaxation. Grab a cold brew ($4.50) and lounge under a tree in the spacious backyard while being serenaded by the local musicians who sometimes appear. As the name, which translates to ''more or less,'' implies, the cafe has a go-with-the-flow culture. Take the food menu, for example, which changes with an evolving roster of guest chefs, announced via Instagram along with a calendar of laid-back events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clockwise from top: a stretch of desert in Joshua Tree National Park; the Out There Bar in Twentynine Palms, Calif., near the park; the ruins of the Wall Street Mill, once used to process gold mined in the area; the Barker Dam Trail, in the park; and lunch dishes at the nearby restaurant La Copine.

    "Lucrative Tax Credit for Making Clean Fuel Won't Be So Easy to Nab\n",

    "Experts had warned that efforts to build a vast new hydrogen industry could inadvertently worsen global warming. New rules aim to avoid that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biden administration on Friday issued its long-awaited plan to provide lucrative tax breaks to companies that make hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel, proposing new rules meant to ensure that the policy doesn't inadvertently lead to a spike in planet-warming emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrogen is widely seen as a promising tool to tackle climate change, as long as it can be produced without creating any greenhouse gases. When burned, hydrogen mainly emits water vapor, and it could be used instead of fossil fuels to make steel or fertilizer, or to power large trucks or ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "But making hydrogen requires energy, and very little so-called clean hydrogen exists today. Currently, most hydrogen is made from natural gas in a process that emits planet-warming carbon dioxide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congress approved a tax credit last year to encourage companies to make more hydrogen from renewable energy and other carbon-free sources, setting off fierce lobbying by businesses focused on who should be able to claim the credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experts have warned that some companies could claim to use wind or solar power to make hydrogen while indirectly causing emissions to go up, and they urged safeguards to prevent that. Some industry groups wanted more lenient rules around the credit, so that a broader range of projects could qualify.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the guidance issued on Friday, the Treasury Department largely sided with those urging tighter restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To qualify for the full tax credit, companies would typically need to use clean electricity from newly built sources, such as wind and solar farms, to run electrolyzers that split water into oxygen and hydrogen. Starting in 2028, those electrolyzers would have to run during the same hours that the wind or solar farms were operating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many hydrogen developers and environmental groups praised the proposal. Without those restrictions, they said, hydrogen producers could draw vast amounts of power from the existing grid and trigger a spike in greenhouse gas emissions if coal- or gas-fired power plants had to run more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The U.S. has the highest tax subsidy for hydrogen in the world, so we think it should have the highest stringency for what counts as clean,'' said Eric Guter, vice president of hydrogen for Air Products & Chemicals Inc., the world's largest producer of hydrogen. The company is developing a $4 billion project with AES in North Texas that will use wind and solar energy to generate hydrogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "But other industry groups criticized the rules, saying they could prevent many early hydrogen projects from being developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Clean Power Association, which represents major wind, solar and transmission companies, said the requirement to match hydrogen production with clean electricity on an hourly basis by 2028 was too stringent.\n",
    "\n",
    "That provision ''will discourage a significant majority of clean power companies from investing in green hydrogen manufacturing and facilities,'' Jason Grumet, chief executive of the group, said in a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Treasury Department will accept comments from the public for 60 days and could make changes before finalizing the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some nuclear power producers, for instance, had asked that the tax credits be available for hydrogen made from existing nuclear plants. But the administration postponed a decision on that question, instead asking the industry for more information. Very few nuclear plants are expected to be built in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost is currently the biggest hurdle to making hydrogen cleanly. While some companies around the world have used wind, solar or nuclear power plants to run electrolyzers and make hydrogen without any emissions, that process costs around $4 to $6 per kilogram of hydrogen. That's about two to three times as expensive as making it with natural gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrogen tax credit was meant to bridge that gap and jump-start a new industry, by providing up to $3 for every kilogram of ''clean'' hydrogen that companies produce over the course of a decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "But defining what counts as ''clean'' turned out to be contentious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of America's electricity still comes from coal and natural gas plants, so if a company were simply to plug a bunch of electrolyzers into the existing grid to make hydrogen, emissions would very likely rise. Similarly, if a hydrogen company tried to use electricity from an existing wind or solar farm, other coal or gas plants might have to run more often to compensate for the lost power. Without safeguards, several studies suggested, the tax credits could inadvertently lead to hundreds of millions of tons of extra carbon dioxide being emitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid that outcome, the Treasury Department proposed several restrictions. To earn the full tax credit, hydrogen producers would have to draw on new sources of clean electricity built within the past three years. That could include a new wind farm or investments that expanded the capacity of an existing nuclear plant. Those plants would have to be located in the same grid region as the hydrogen factory. And, starting in 2028, the electrolyzers could only run in the same hours that the clean power was available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hydrogen companies said the proposed rules could be difficult to follow. Wind and solar power don't run all the time, and trying to match hydrogen output to renewable fluctuations on an hourly basis would increase costs, they said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''This policy will make it harder for everyone,'' said Jacob Susman, chief executive of Ambient Fuels, a clean hydrogen developer that had been planning roughly $700 million in new projects. Still, he said his company would try to work with the new rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other companies and experts said the new rules around hourly matching could spur innovation. One U.S. startup, Electric Hydrogen, is making an electrolyzer designed to ramp up and down with solar and wind output. The new rules could give that sort of technology a leg up over the less-flexible electrolyzers made in China, the company said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There will be a lobbying blitz around the final rule,'' said Rachel Fakhry, policy director for emerging technologies at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. ''We're watching closely to make sure there aren't any new loopholes that will be harmful for emissions or consumers.''\n",
    "\n",
    "It is still unclear how much clean hydrogen the United States will actually produce in the coming years. Although the Biden administration has laid out a strategy to produce 50 million tons of clean hydrogen by 2050, more than 50 times what is produced today, there are steep obstacles, including setting up systems to transport hydrogen and finding buyers for the fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, the Energy Department is also spending $7 billion to create hydrogen hubs around the country to connect producers and buyers, while setting up programs to stimulate demand for hydrogen and reduce the cost of electrolyzers.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There are an awful lot of tools in our clean hydrogen tool belt that we didn't have before,'' said David Turk, the deputy secretary of energy. ''There's a huge opportunity here.''\n",

    "\n",
    "According to Mr. Schmitz, the key to understanding Donald Trump's electoral appeal is not his authoritarianism but his moderation. There may have been some truth to this eight years ago, when Mr. Trump's policy views were often poorly defined. However, it is clearly no longer true in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a wide range of issues, including immigration, climate change, health care and gun control, Mr. Trump has endorsed policies supported by the right wing of the Republican Party. And when it comes to abortion, whatever his recent public statements, while he was in office, he consistently appointed anti-abortion judges committed to overturning Roe v. Wade.\n",

    "As a result, Mr. Trump now appeals most strongly to the far right wing of the Republican Party. Donald Trump is no moderate.\n",

    "\n",
    "You report that the people surveyed trusted Donald Trump to manage the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over President Biden by a margin of 46 percent to 38 percent. This is puzzling, since during his tenure as president, Mr. Trump was an extreme Israeli partisan. Indeed, everything he did with reference to the Middle East heavily favored Israel to the detriment of the Palestinians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the actions that he undertook that were adverse to the Palestinians included: the appointment of an extreme Orthodox Jewish bankruptcy lawyer, who was an Israeli partisan, as ambassador to Israel; moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, contrary to both decades of American policy and Palestinian opposition; terminating American contributions to the U.N. fund for Palestinians; supporting the Israeli settler movement; and negotiating the Abraham Accords without any consideration of Palestinian interests.\n",

    "\n",
    "Increasingly, as the traumatized Israeli pursuit of Hamas costs more death and destruction, cracks are appearing in Jewish community support for the Biden administration's military and political backing of the current Israeli government. President Biden is well advised to pay close attention to these cracks.\n",

    "\n",
    "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration on Friday proposed tough new rules for a valuable climate subsidy, siding with environmental groups despite warnings from some of the nation's biggest energy companies that strict limits could stifle a critical industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed criteria would determine who gets generous tax credits for producing hydrogen, one of the few viable replacements for fossil fuels in heavy industries such as steelmaking and shipping, where renewable electricity and batteries aren't sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies including NextEra Energy, BP and Constellation Energy had warned that restrictive rules for the tax credit could cause project cancellations and prevent the nascent industry from taking off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These proposed regulations and requirements will unnecessarily hold back our domestic industry, driving investment, manufacturing and technology leadership overseas,\" Frank Wolak, chief executive of the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association, said in a statement. The industry group's members include Exxon Mobil and Plug Power, a maker of fuel cells that hopes to become a leading green hydrogen supplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules proposed Friday govern how companies seeking to claim the tax credit must purchase electricity that is needed to make hydrogen. Environmental groups, academics and some companies said looser rules for those purchases would lead to higher emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's especially important to get these rules right,\" said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, noting that some projects under Friday's regulations would get the tax breaks into the 2040s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies such as Air Products and Chemicals also pushed for tighter standards. Air Products and power company AES plan to develop new wind and solar energy to make hydrogen in a $4 billion Texas project that would meet the criteria proposed Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long-awaited rules have been some of the most contentious regulations stemming from last year's Inflation Reduction Act. The tax credit is significant, potentially covering more than half of a typical green hydrogen project's cost. And it will define a new industry because clean hydrogen is too expensive to produce today without subsidies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. hopes to increase clean hydrogen production to 50 million metric tons a year by midcentury, from less than 1 million currently, to meet its climate goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrogen tax-credit rules are the latest example of companies clashing over some $1 trillion in subsidies for everything from electric cars to solar panels. The tax credits are pitting the administration's climate goals against its efforts to create domestic manufacturing jobs and boost the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all hydrogen today is made by heating natural gas. The method is cheap, but it generates greenhouse-gas emissions. Those can be lowered or eliminated by switching to machines powered by renewable energy that split water into so-called green hydrogen and oxygen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new tax credit gets more valuable as the production process generates less emissions. The maximum amount for the cleanest hydrogen is $3 per kilogram, roughly enough to make green hydrogen cost-competitive with hydrogen made from natural gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tax credit comes on top of several billion dollars in federal funding for hydrogen megaprojects across the country and other subsidies to spur demand for clean hydrogen and lower the cost of electrolyzers, the devices that split water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies and environmental groups conducted a monthslong lobbying and advertising campaign, aiming to sway administration officials in advance of Friday's announcement. The crux of the conflict is over whether companies planning to use fossil-fuel power from electricity grids to make hydrogen would have to buy equivalent renewable energy on an hourly basis, or on a looser annual standard, to qualify for the tax credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules proposed Friday by the Treasury Department would make companies match their electricity use every hour starting in 2028, earlier than many companies and industry groups wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies and environmental groups will have 60 days to respond with fresh comments before the government sets final rules.\n",

    "The Financial Accounting Standards Board has a busy year ahead of it. It will be advancing projects in three tentpole areas -- accounting for software costs and environmental credits and greater disclosure of income-statement expenses -- aimed at providing investors with new financial insight, Chairman Rich Jones said.\n",
    "\n",
    "New rules, which can take years to come to fruition, can also saddle companies with a greater compliance burden. But in outlining his 2024 agenda, Jones said the U.S. accounting standard-setter will again be asking investors and other stakeholders which issues to take up next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FASB last sought input from investors in an \"agenda consultation\" in 2021, and has been working off those issues since. In recent weeks, for instance, the FASB has issued rules tackling how to account for cryptocurrency assets and will require disclosure of big-ticket expenses incurred by business divisions and more information on the income taxes companies pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "With its slate of new projects shrinking as a result, the FASB aims to hold another agenda consultation in 2024, likely in the second half of the year, to gauge what issues to prioritize. \"I think it's an important way that we consistently make sure that we are being responsive to our stakeholders and making sure we're keeping accounting and financial reporting up-to-date,\" Jones said.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the board has at least three core projects -- on software costs, environmental credits and income-statement expenses -- heading into 2024, according to Jones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024, the FASB could finalize a rule requiring publicly traded businesses to break out things like inventory expenses and employee compensation in the footnotes of their financial statements. Businesses from Apple to Starbucks have pushed the FASB to revise the proposal it issued in July, saying it would be costly to carry out, and deliver little benefit to investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jones conceded the rule would increase compliance efforts at companies. \"Not only would it have the largest impact on companies across industries, it is likely the highest priority for investors, too,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "How companies account for and disclose software costs might also be updated -- in a major way. Largely unchanged since the 1980s and '90s, the current rules lay out two different models depending on whether a company develops software, or just uses it in their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the FASB is considering a single accounting model for all companies. Under this model, a company would have to expense over time all its direct software costs starting when they deem a software project's eventual completion to be probable and until they substantially have completed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For companies that license software, a new standard could mark a \"very significant change,\" Jones said. \"It might be a subset [of public companies], but from a market capitalization perspective, it's an awfully big subset,\" he said. Any rule, however, is a ways off. The board is expected to vote next year on whether or not to issue a proposal, Jones said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next year might also bring a proposal on specific rules to account for environmental credits -- for the first time. Currently, there are no specific environmental accounting rules companies must follow when recording these transactions. The project would apply one model to various credits that companies obtain for their compliance programs or to voluntarily burnish their green credentials, including renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets, as more companies incorporate them into their operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "That proposal is likely in the second half of the year, Jones said. The FASB also hopes to serve up proposals on government grants and derivatives, among others, he added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the push and pull of upcoming issues, finance executives in 2024 will be preparing to address a raft of new requirements: disclosure of new details on their taxes, crypto assets and large segment expenses, combined with new Securities and Exchange Commission rules and a flurry of climate-disclosure mandates from California, Europe and elsewhere.\n",

    "The heroes of this story are the daring bush pilots at General Motors who managed to land our test car, the 2024 Chevy Trax 2RS, on the shortest of runways: $28,085, as tested, including $1,545 in options.\n",
    "\n",
    "That could not have been easy. For one thing, the new Trax -- \"reimagined\" for 2024, GM says -- is quite a bit bigger: 11 inches longer, 2 inches wider, on a six-inch longer wheelbase, adding six cubic feet of cargo space. If nothing else the price absorbs added material costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For another, the Trax -- GM's least costly product in the U.S. -- comes well stocked with standard content. Available in five trim levels, all of which start under $25,000, the free buffet includes Chevy Safety Assist (forward collision alert, front pedestrian braking, automatic high beam LED headlights, lane-keeping assist/lane departure warning); wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; and high-definition rearview camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2RS trim, the Trax ingratiates with a long list of creature features, starting with the nifty two-tone leatherette upholstery with embroidered headrests; heated front seats, steering wheel and outside mirror; an 11-inch infotainment touch screen; automatic climate control; keyless open; and rear-seat USB ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cheap plastic is fantastic: The interior's sturdy hard-touch panels, including the dash top, are damasked with subtle digital patterns, or else lacquer black. This thing is built like a salon-quality hair dryer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some heat on the outside, as well, starting with the 2RS's unreasonably handsome 19-inch alloy wheels. All models sport LED headlamps and daytime running lights. RS models wear a piano-black mask across the grille area with an embedded RS badge. The test car had the sunroof option ($895), which includes wireless charging, as well as the adaptive cruise control package ($650).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trax pulls off its cornucopian magic by being, in other respects, a simple, even primitive automobile, boring to the bone. Under the hood is a turbocharged 1.2-liter, three-cylinder engine, stirring up to 137 hp at 5,000 rpm and 162 lb-ft at 2,500 rpm, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission sending power to the front wheels. Coil-over strut front suspension, torsion-beam rear -- no fuss, no muss. Most of the Trax program's treasure is spent on its tech-y amenities, not the host vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fuel economy is also retro: 30 mpg, on average, according to the EPA's test cycle. I saw nothing of the sort and I'm not surprised. As I went about my daily and non-exceptional driving chores, I had my foot in it, deep and often. Partly that was due to the limited supply of traction under the front wheels. Also, in order to overcome the fuel-saving latency coded into the transmission logic, I sometimes had to stomp the pedal like the wine glass at a Jewish wedding. L'Chaim!\n",

    "In any event, merging into competitive interstate traffic is an exercise in mindfulness. Once in the flow of traffic, all 137 hp are committed to station keeping, never mind overtaking. According to the literature, Traxes feature noise-canceling technology, to which I say, Huh? What was that? Antisocial phrenology? At full throttle the three-banger buzzes like a beehive top hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first logic gate for bargain-hunters, therefore, has to do with their daily driving patterns. For those who spend hours each week fencing with fellow commuters on fast-moving freeways, the Trax RS will feel like a rubber rapier. But for short-hop commuters, operating mostly on surface streets and urban boulevards, the Trax is peppy enough (also my stage name in college).\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm all up in my feelings on this one. On the one hand, I like nothing better than a great, cheap car -- sorry, attainably priced. And in many ways the Trax RS lives like a huge bargain. Honestly, I think you could sell cars with square wheels if they had heated steering wheels. And with five full-size seats and lots of rear stowage, it lives friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, buyers often waste money on power and performance they will never use in the real world. The road itself, the shared commons of rules and asphalt, establishes the boundary conditions for automotive performance; engineering beyond which merely feeds competitive consumerism and checkbook masculinity. Most people wouldn't know a MacPherson strut from the Hollywood Shuffle. I'm sympathetic to the idea that younger buyers are more interested in the toys than the steel boxes they come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which brings us to the next branch in the decision tree: new or used? At these prices, the Trax's keenest competition might be a preowned something-something. But for younger buyers, I imagine, the Trax's freer, fresher tech -- in particular, standard Apple/Android connectivity -- will make the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: GM announced earlier this year that it would drop the popular Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility in favor of its own, Google-based telematics system. (The backlash has been epic, by the way, and if you don't believe me, see reader comments below). GM's decision raises the possibility that near-term Traxes will be able to grok Apple and Android while later ones will not. Buy now or forever hold your phone?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trax RS looks good in person, bearing a strong family resemblance to GM's more urbane people movers such as the new Chevy Blazer. The Trax's creases and light lines pinch together along the fuselage like the folds of a bowtie's knot -- I see what you did there. The fit-and-finish of our test car seemed pretty spot on, with consistent seams and gaps around every body opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, the Trax has a platform friend, the Buick Envista, offering the same general form with a bit less erotic provocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm looking forward to that one. After the Trax, I'm spent.\n",

    "The Biden Administration gave its friends in the climate lobby an early Christmas gift on Tuesday by restricting logging on tens of millions of acres of national forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Forest Service is proposing, for the first time, to amend simultaneously all of its forest management plans to effectively ban logging on nearly 25 million acres of \"old growth\" forests. This is a land grab if there ever was one. The agency claims that conserving older trees will fight climate change since they suck up and store CO2. Not if they go up in smoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "For years the feds have struggled to manage overgrown forests to prevent wildfires, and the Biden proposal will add to the challenge. The deputy chief of the National Forest System told regional leaders that management work in old-growth areas will henceforth need approval from Washington, D.C., to proceed, which will slow vital work on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Administration's proposal will also invariably be used by green groups to stop fire mitigation projects and will take staff time away from implementing them, as Montana Sen. Steve Daines notes in a letter to the Administration. Timber companies also manage forests better than the government since they have an economic incentive to prevent uncontrolled fires.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Forest Service says wildfires are the top threat to old-growth forests, so its plan will undermine its stated goal of preserving trees and might increase CO2 emissions and harmful pollutants. Canadian wildfires this year released an estimated 0.5 to 0.8 gigatons of CO2 -- about as much as 109 million to 174 million gas-powered cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan also won't stop logging. More will occur elsewhere, resulting in greater lumber imports. How does this help the climate or U.S. jobs? The Administration has extended the Trump tariffs on Canadian lumber, which increase the cost of home-building. Its strategy seems to be to use regulation to restrict domestic supply, then raise prices with tariffs. Bidenomics at work, again.\n",

    "ANELO, Argentina -- South America has long been the world's sleeping energy giant, with massive oil-and-gas reserves still untapped. Now it is rumbling awake, with huge implications for the global market.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the deep waters off the northern shoulder of the continent down to Patagonia, a number of countries in the region are ramping up oil-and-gas production even as developed economies race to cut carbon emissions and reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.\n",
    "\n",
    "And South American companies are fast trying to position themselves to become new global suppliers as Western governments and energy majors are increasingly looking at the region to diversify away from conflict-ridden choke points of the Middle East and Russia.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What we know is that Europe and the Western world is never going back to depending on Russian gas,\" said Marcelo Mindlin, president of Buenos Aires-based Pampa Energia. \"This is a big opportunity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "His company is among a number that are increasingly active in Argentina's massive oil-and-gas patch called Vaca Muerta -- which means dead cow in Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sitting on arid, windswept terrain as big as Belgium near Argentina's border with Chile, the shale field has potential output comparable to the Permian Basin, long the most prolific region in the U.S., according to Rystad Energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chronic economic crises and rigid currency controls have long hindered infrastructure development in Argentina, economists say, leaving trucks slowly plying dirt roads around rigs while companies struggle to import drilling equipment amid dollar shortages.\n",
    "\n",
    "But because of a new political landscape in the country, Vaca Muerta could soon turn into a cash cow, say government officials and oil executives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The country's new libertarian President Javier Milei is promising a sweeping deregulation and privatization of the industry, sending local energy stocks soaring since his victory in November's elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Argentina is starting a new stage of history in the energy sector,\" said Eduardo Rodriguez Chirillo, the new government's energy secretary.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a U.N.climate conference in Dubai last week, 190 countries agreed for the first time to transition away from fossil fuels but essentially allowed governments to choose their own paths to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent activity in South America indicates countries in this region don't intend to dial back soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steadily rising output from non-OPEC countries in the Americas, excluding the U.S., is set to add 1.3 million barrels a day of new oil supply in 2025, more than covering the 1 million barrels a day of new demand that is projected for that year, according to J.P. Morgan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brazil, which posted record oil-and-gas output of 4.7 million barrels a day in September, is slated to overtake Canada as the world's fourth-largest producer when it pumps 5.4 million daily by 2029, according to the energy ministry.\n",
    "\n",
    "President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has heralded the developments and has said that while his government wants to join OPEC+ next year as an observer, it doesn't want to be bound to the cartel's production limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jean Paul Prates, chief executive of Brazilian state oil company Petrobras, said the increase is a recognition that the global economy will need oil for decades despite projections that fossil-fuel demand could peak by the end of this one. His company plans to funnel more than 70% of its $102 billion investment plan over the next four years into production and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offshore drilling in Brazil's smaller neighbors, Suriname and Guyana, is also contributing to the regional production boost. The latter has become one of the region's hottest energy frontiers with Guyana's production, via an Exxon-led consortium, slated to top a million barrels a day by 2027.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro recently said his country was ready to re-enter global-energy markets after it reached a deal with the Biden administration in October that temporarily lifted oil-sector sanctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lobbyists for oil companies -- from U.S. giant Chevron to Indian refiner Reliance -- had pushed Washington for more than a year to ease the sanctions, arguing that restarting Venezuelan energy exports would help mitigate the disruptions in global markets caused by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, the U.S. and Venezuela agreed to swap prisoners, in a sign that thawing relations between the countries could keep economic sanctions out of the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "But political risk will continue to weigh on Latin American oil prospects. The U.S. has said sanctions could be reapplied on Venezuela if Maduro's authoritarian government doesn't organize free and fair elections next year. Venezuela also is threatening to annex most of Guyana's land.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Argentina, despite the leadership change, the economy remains hamstrung by galloping inflation and severe restrictions on companies' access to U.S. dollars, stymieing foreign investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Wednesday, Milei, a self-described anarcho-capitalist, decreed a series of economic measures that aim to remove the role of the state in key economic sectors. The announcement followed on his campaign promises to slash taxes and dramatically cut spending by eliminating half of government ministries and eventually privatizing state-run energy firm YPF, which controls about a third of Vaca Muerta's production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the obstacles for the Milei administration, hope is rising across Argentina's political spectrum that Vaca Muerta's oil-and-gas deposits could boost the crippled economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When you need scale and hard dollars rapidly, you have one button: Vaca Muerta's shale oil,\" said Miguel Galuccio, chief executive of Vista Energy and a former president of YPF who ran that company for four years after it was nationalized by Argentina in 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Vaca Muerta is part of the solution. It can contribute to Argentina's macroeconomic stabilization.\"\n",

    "More Production Could Boost Ailing Argentine Economy\n",
    "\n",
    "The huge oil-and-gas patch called Vaca Muerta, which sits near Argentina's border with Chile, is spurring hope across Argentina's political spectrum that its deposits could boost the country's crippled economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased energy production could redraw much of the regional-energy map and help eliminate Argentina's need for gas imports during the winter, which came as a hefty burden to the government last year because of Russia's invasion and war with Ukraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Center for Political Economy, an Argentine policy group, estimates that replacing gas imports could generate $3 billion in annual savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much depends on the country's macroeconomic situation and whether contractors can resolve bottlenecks and unpaid import bills caused by currency controls, said Marcelo Mindlin, president of Buenos Aires-based Pampa Energia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pampa holds concessions covering 8% of Vaca Muerta, but the company has only drilled 46, or about 2%, of the nearly 2,000 wells they believe they could exploit.\n",

    "\"We have a super aggressive plan,\" Mindlin said. \"With a country that is more stable, it could be something we'd be able to do.\"\n",

    "Walking toward the shrinking remnants of what used to be the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan was like entering hell.\n",
    "\n",
    "All around was a desert devoid of life, aside from scrubby saxaul trees. Dust swirled in 110-degree Fahrenheit heat under a throbbing red sun. I reached the edge of one of the scattered lakes that are all that remain of this once-great body of water. I took off my shoes and waded in. The water was so full of salt that it felt viscous, not quite liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the nearby town of Muynak, black-and-white newsreels in the local museum and pictures in the family photo albums of residents tell of better times. During the Soviet era, fishing communities like Muynak ringed the sea, thriving off its bounty: sturgeon, flounder, caviar and other staples of Soviet dinner tables. In the town I met Oktyabr Dospanov, an archaeologist who grew up along the Aral's shores and recalls a ''happy life'' in his youth, when fishing boats, passenger ships and cargo trawlers plied the sea's waves around the clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "But over the decades, Soviet authorities diverted rivers that flowed into the sea to irrigate cotton and other crops. The world's fourth-largest inland body of water -- which covered an area about 15 percent larger than Lake Michigan -- gradually shrank, triggering a domino effect of ecological, economic and community collapse, the kind of catastrophe that could befall other environmentally fragile parts of the world unless we change our ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "By 2007, the sea's surface area had shrunk by around 90 percent, leaving Muynak a landlocked way station for tourists who come to marvel at this ecological disaster, where they take selfies near rusting ship hulks that are perched high and dry in the endless sand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although restoration efforts in recent years have led to small improvements in some areas, the former expanse of the Aral Sea is a blighted realm, where a scattering of far smaller, brackish lakes lie like puddles in a vast dry basin. The Aral Sea is now the Aralkum Desert. Over the decades, soil and water were contaminated by pesticides and other pollutants, which are suspected of causing birth defects and other chronic health problems in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Aral Sea died, the region's once-rich pastures and forests began to degrade, according to Mr. Dospanov. Birds, insects and other wildlife that depend on the sea and its wider environment disappeared. It was as if without the sea, biodiversity went into freefall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salty dust blown from the parched seabed has severely affected crops. Other livelihoods tied to the sea have also suffered, and over the decades local incomes fell and unemployment rose. The population of the region dropped as people migrated to the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, or to Moscow, where many work in construction or other low-paying jobs and often face discrimination. An entire natural and human ecosystem was destroyed. Worse, the Soviet authorities knew what was happening, but priorities like economic growth seemed more important. By the 1980s, authorities even considered compounding the folly by diverting water from Lake Baikal in Siberia, more than 2,000 miles away, to the Aral region. The Soviet Union collapsed before that scheme could be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, protests broke out in Karakalpakstan, the region where the Aral Sea was, after a proposal by the government of Uzbekistan that would have reduced the region's autonomy. Many observers have noted that economic and environmental hardship related to the sea's demise have added to the region's volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The really scary thing about the Aral Sea is that environmental catastrophes like it are being replicated across the world. We see refugees fleeing from uninhabitable homelands, bitter conflicts over scarce resources and land, and cities threatened by rising sea levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, Lake Mead and the Great Salt Lake are shrinking, and cities like Los Angeles are racing to balance their water needs with a changing climate. Agriculture, fracking, lawn maintenance and other activities are rapidly depleting groundwater aquifers across America. Can we live with the possibility that other places are headed for a fate similar to the Aral Sea's? The human race is using up its water and other resources like there's no tomorrow, but as the residents of Muynak found out, there was a tomorrow, just not the one they were hoping for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Mr. Dospanov, the sea was a microcosm of humanity's deep economic and social connection to the environment. A culture and a way of life blossomed around the Aral Sea, in symbiosis with it, dependent upon it. But the sea's destruction caused everything else to collapse along with it, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "I left for Tashkent to catch a flight back to China, where I live, eager to leave Karakalpakstan behind. But I would have to wait: Beijing had been hit by the heaviest rains in years (prompting discussion of whether climate change was partly to blame), stranding me for a while in Tashkent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aral Sea stands as a grim parable, a warning of what can come from humanity's environmental hubris. If we continue this way, waiting for somebody else to do something or letting short-term economic interests stand in the way, we may find ourselves like Mr. Dospanov, telling visitors about how beautiful our home once was.\n",

    "Octopus DNA Shows  Climate  Change Is Threatening West Antarctic Ice Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "By Delger Erdenesanaa \n",
    "985 words\n",

    "A huge ice sheet appears to have melted about 120,000 years ago, when temperatures were similar to those on Earth today, according to a DNA study that mapped octopus movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists have long wondered whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is a ticking time bomb in terms of sea level rise. New evidence from the DNA of a small octopus that lives in the Southern Ocean suggests that the ice sheet is indeed at risk of collapsing, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research doesn't predict when this might happen, but it indicates that 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming over the preindustrial global average, or perhaps even less than that, might be a tipping point for the ice sheet. The Earth is close to that temperature level now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several distinct populations of Pareledone turqueti, commonly known as Turquet's octopus, live in the waters around Antarctica today. These octopuses crawl along the sea floor and generally don't stray far from home. A few individuals or their eggs might occasionally drift on currents to neighboring groups, but populations in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea are separated by the impassable West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, genetic analysis of octopuses from different locations around Antarctica show that these two populations were mingling and swapping DNA about 120,000 years ago. This was a time in Earth's history called the Last Interglacial period, before the most recent ice age, when temperatures were similar to today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed patterns in the octopus gene pool would only be possible if the West Antarctic ice sheet wasn't there at the time and relatively open seaways across the continent allowed the octopuses to travel freely between the Ross and Weddell Seas, according to the researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists know that sea levels were several meters higher then. But whether the additional water came from West Antarctica is ''the question that the geoscience community has been trying to answer for nearly 50 years,'' said Sally Lau, a postdoctoral researcher at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, and lead author on the new study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the global average temperature is about 1.2 degrees Celsius higher than it was from 1850 to 1900, when the burning of fossil fuels began warming the climate. During the Last Interglacial, the global average temperature was similarly about 0.5 to 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than that preindustrial base line, but sea levels were five to 10 meters higher than today. If climate change melts the West Antarctic ice sheet entirely, sea levels could rise by an average of up to five meters, or 16 feet. (The East Antarctic Ice Sheet holds even more frozen water, but it is considered more stable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers did not explicitly state whether today's temperatures had already committed the planet to a complete collapse of the western ice sheet. ''We're still not able to say for certain, but that's definitely the implication,'' said Nicholas Golledge, a professor of glaciology at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and another author of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ice sheet has already reached a tipping point, estimates for how quickly it might melt range anywhere from 200 years to 2,000 years. ''Our actions from this point on will still change the rate at which we get there,'' Dr. Golledge said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike today, the Last Interglacial was part of an ongoing natural cycle of changes in the tilt of Earth's axis and its orbit around the sun, and the resulting changes in the amount of sunlight the planet receives. These cycles happen gradually over tens of thousands of years. Our current greenhouse gas emissions are causing similar changes in temperature, but at a much faster rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the reasons behind past and current warming are different, the Last Interglacial is still one of the best analogues for present-day climate change, said Roger Creel, a postdoctoral scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He was not involved in the study published Thursday but has contributed to estimates of sea level during that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's such strong evidence from a completely different vantage point than the climate community often has,'' Dr. Creel said of the new study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the octopus specimens Dr. Lau studied were collected more than 30 years ago, from fishing boats and scientific expeditions, and held in museums. Because DNA in dead animals degrades over time, this type of research using museum specimens hasn't been possible until very recently with advances in genetic sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other scientists have shown that the population genetics of land animals line up with past melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. A 2020 study of springtails, small invertebrates that live in soil, also suggested that ice in the Ross Sea region had melted away during warm periods over the past 5 million years, including during the Last Interglacial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoscientists can use mathematical models to reconstruct ice sheets and sea levels of the past, but the emerging biological evidence can help corroborate these reconstructions, said Ian Hogg, a research scientist at Polar Knowledge Canada, an agency that monitors polar regions, and an author of the study of springtails.\n",

    "The Atlantean hero-king returns as a new father, a bit worse for wear. But this sequel feels like a film for grown-ups who like fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "I just feel bad for Orm. He's pompous and strangely boring, but the guy's heart is basically in the right place. In the first ''Aquaman'' movie, he was so upset by the surface dwellers (that's us) who have polluted the seas -- the home of his people -- that he wanted to unite the armies of Atlantis and punish us. Who could blame him?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet his crown was stripped away by his half brother, a swaggering goofball with a raggedy haircut who grew up above the surface. Same guy also stole Orm's fiancée, beat him in a fight in front of the whole nation and imprisoned him. Also, this brother, Arthur, has a cool nickname, while Orm is saddled with a moniker that sounds like the noise you make when someone elbows you in the gut. Fate has been no friend to Orm.\n",
    "\n",
    "When James Wan's delightful stand-alone movie about the Atlantean hero-king Aquaman (a.k.a. Arthur) and his sad-sack brother came out in 2018, I found Patrick Wilson's Orm, who is very handsome in a slightly bland manner, to be the dullest part of an entertaining romp. Aquaman, as played by the towering trunk of a man named Jason Momoa, was quippy and funny, delivering his lines with just enough of an off-kilter smirk to make him, and his movie, a hit. Orm was his foil and his nemesis, the kind of bitter brotherly rivalry that exists across histories both real and imagined.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Video: Watch on YouTube.]\n",
    "\n",
    "But in ''Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,'' for which Wan and most of his cast returned, Orm is -- fun? Sure, when we meet him again he is enduring the distinctly un-fun experience of being imprisoned by death-worshipping ascetics who drink blood for sustenance, and he looks, as Arthur says, rough. Once revived a bit, he's still pompous and bitter and prone to speaking without the use of contractions. But he's developed a personality and a mild sense of humor, and he ends up eating bugs with enjoyment. Good for Orm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, right, Arthur is back, too. He's grown a little boring since we last saw him, a fate that admittedly greets many exhausted parents of young children. He and Mera (Amber Heard) split their time between Atlantis, where they rule, and the lighthouse, where their bouncing baby boy, Arthur Jr., stays with his grandfather (Temuera Morrison) and urinates in Arthur's eye during diaper changes. At work, Arthur has learned, to his chagrin, a lesson best summed up in ''Hamilton'': winning was easy, but governing's harder. He has to deal with the Council, who are annoyed that he spends so much time on the surface, and he has to protect his people from enemies, foreign and domestic. On top of everything, there's a plague going around under the sea, fierce enough to have taken the life of Arthur's mentor Vulko. (Presumably Willem Dafoe was off doing other things, like ''Poor Things.'')\n",
    "\n",
    "The mention of a plague in 2023 brings with it more visceral, viral baggage than it would have in 2018, and as in our world, this crisis is compounded by polluted waters and warming temperatures. The notion of human-driven climate change as an inciting factor for turmoil was present in the first ''Aquaman'' -- how could it not have been? -- but it's foregrounded in this sequel and linked explicitly to the antagonist: David Kane a.k.a. Black Manta (the always-terrific Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who is still extremely angry with Arthur for killing his father. He's teamed up with Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), the Atlantis-obsessed scientist glimpsed in the first movie, to find and destroy his prey.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a whole bunch of subplots in ''Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,'' the least interesting of which is the actual Lost Kingdom. Everything is tangentially related to orichalcum, which in real life is an alloy beloved by the ancients for its resemblance to gold. In Aquaman's world, it's a substance the ancients used to generate power that has nearly destroyed the world because -- as Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) explains to her sons -- it emits a whole lot of greenhouse gases. (People in the movie talk so seriously and incessantly about orichalcum that people at my screening started to giggle.) Obviously, bad guys like Black Manta want this substance, and will stop at nothing, not even the destruction of the planet, to get it and the power it brings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a metaphor, and a straightforward one at that -- refreshing, as metaphors about power (and fascism and authoritarianism) are often muddled and pointless in superhero films. Linking greed, power, death and destruction to a rapidly warming planet makes narrative sense in this context. (Though this point does get slightly undermined, in that characters angrily denounce planet-warming emissions but tuck happily into beef burgers -- but this is also a movie in which an octopus rides a seahorse, so it's probably wise not to get too caught up in the specifics.)\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes the ''Aquaman'' franchise work is Wan's hand pulling the strings. He's one of the great horror writers and directors of our time (he had a part in creating the ''Saw,'' ''Insidious,'' and ''Conjuring'' franchises, to name just a few), and it shows in his melding of adventure with sheer creepiness. You can sense influences ranging from Japanese monsters movies and Tolkien to ''Mad Max'' and ''Indiana Jones,'' all done with a light touch. Wan takes Aquaman's story beyond the paint-by-numbers superhero movies we've been watching for decades now, and that makes it feel like a film for grown-ups who like fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Admittedly, ''Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'' is not as fun as ''Aquaman'' was. That might be inevitable. Building a world tends to be more exciting than living in it. The film's emotional core rests not on the genuinely sweet love story of Atlanna and Tom, or even of Arthur and Mera, but on this less affecting brotherly relationship. Arthur's quips are getting less charming and more grating. And you might find yourself wondering exactly how many times someone can be saved at the last second.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the movie is clever enough, and plenty scary, and there is a sufficient number of jokes to keep the whole thing from getting too self-important. Even Orm loosens up by the end. There's hope for him yet.\n",

    "\n",
    "Offshore wind projects need to be reconsidered in both scale and financing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Times accurately identifies the causes for delays and cancellations of ambitious offshore wind projects in the Northeast Atlantic. But the success of the recent launch of the South Fork Wind project may underscore another reason so many of the huge projects have been stymied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The South Fork Wind project, 35 miles off the coast of Montauk, N.Y., when fully operational, will produce electricity to fuel 70,000 homes on eastern Long Island and will offset tons of carbon emissions each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale of the project -- 12 turbines -- is appropriate to its siting in an area close to densely populated neighborhoods and in waters trafficked by commercial fishing and recreational boating activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the huge projects now being stymied by delays and cancellations would site hundreds of turbines in an even busier Atlantic corridor. These projects should be scaled back to a more appropriate size and, if costs remain prohibitively high, should be subsidized by federal and state governments.\n",

    "The focus on course correcting is spot-on. We cannot and should not lessen our resolve to develop offshore wind as a solution to the growing instability of our climate. You need only look at the stark ocean events happening faster than expected -- marine heat waves, bleaching coral reefs, disappearing species -- to see the need for renewables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, a reset for offshore wind should not come without a renewed commitment to responsible development that considers the environment and people. If offshore wind is to be successful, beyond overcoming the financial hurdles, it must avoid, minimize and mitigate negative impacts to our marine ecosystems, Native American tribes and the fishing industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through early and robust engagement with these affected communities and investments in marine mitigation technology and strategies, we can avoid more stumbling blocks in the future, and ensure that offshore wind is able to do what it needs to in the long run: protect us, the ocean and marine species from the worst effects of climate change.\n",

    "''Bidenomics'' may be well intentioned but ties President Biden personally to voters' economic woes, making him a target for ridicule.

    "\n",
    "This article about how difficult it is for families to find affordable home care will ring true to many readers. However, it should have also mentioned the problems families have in complying with tax and regulatory responsibilities if they hire aides directly (as is common) rather than through an agency.\n",

    "As employers, they must keep accurate payment records, prepare W-2 statements, pay the employer share of employment taxes, and often file and fund quarterly state tax reports. Simply finding out about the requirements is challenging.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some simple changes would help. First and foremost, every state should prepare and publicize a guide to regulatory and tax responsibilities when the family employs aides instead of using an agency.

    "Writing a newspaper column necessarily is a dour exercise most of the time. The point is to highlight things going wrong that ought to be fixed. Occasionally, however, it's worth noting some things that are going right that one hopes can continue. Here, in the midst of a season that calls for reflection and gratitude, is my list:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- The world's population keeps getting larger. We're on track to welcome our 8,100,000,000th global neighbor in 2024, after population growth of around 70 million this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this is a good thing. People have been going out of fashion since the days of the Rev. Thomas Malthus, and the trend only picked up steam in the 20th century with nonsense such as Paul Ehrlich's 1968 book, \"The Population Bomb.\" Even today, the fashionable rich like to signal their putative virtue by announcing their plans to have fewer children.\n",
    "\n",
    "But people are an asset, not a liability. On a human level, more people means more family relationships and friendships. The former in particular are in short supply in countries such as China that have had the capacity (and the nihilistic ideological antecedents) to limit population growth in draconian fashion -- with catastrophic social consequences. On an economic level, more people means more potential for innovation and therefore more, rather than less, prosperity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- The global economy keeps growing. Speaking of prosperity, the International Monetary Fund estimates the global economy will have grown 3% in inflation-adjusted terms this year, and 2.9% next year. That's slower than it could and should be, for many reasons, but still positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with population, it's more controversial than it should be to describe this as good news. That's mainly because this growth is achieved largely on the back of fossil fuels that provide the energy necessary to lift millions of people out of poverty each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon scolds say a climate catastrophe decades in the future (if it ever arrives) will endanger the prosperity of residents in today's developing countries. The implication, although the climate left rarely says it outright, is that the poor are better off staying that way while they wait for windmills than they would be growing rich today by emitting more carbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more acute danger is the poverty itself, and mercifully there is less of this than ever before. The proportion of the world's population living on less than $2.15 a day (inflation adjusted), the World Bank's current metric for the most extreme poverty, has fallen below 10%, compared with nearly 44% in 1981. Understand what this means in human terms: more and better healthcare, less hunger, more opportunities for personal growth as resources become less of a constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Freedom still is in fashion. Reports of the death of democracy turn out to be wildly exaggerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, even with the prospect that Donald Trump could win a 2024 presidential election that promises to be awful for all the expected reasons and probably some unexpected ones, too. And despite the rise of \"far-right\" politicians and parties in Europe that too often are branded fascist or despotic. Ignore what a myopic Western press corps says about democracy, and look at what people around the world actually do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dozens of brave Hong Kongers sit in jail for defying the Chinese Communist Party as Beijing tries to rob their city of its freedoms. One of them, newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai, has gone on trial this week for the allegedly subversive act of committing journalism in what used to be a great financial center. On the mainland, the Communist Party after more than seven decades in power still must engage in aggressive censorship of social media because ordinary Chinese citizens want to discuss what's wrong with their rulers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ayatollahs' theocratic rule of Iran looks ever more brittle as citizens rebel against economic dysfunction and authoritarian religious social controls. In Russia, Vladimir Putin will have a challenger in next year's presidential \"election.\" Yekaterina Duntsova, a relatively unknown journalist and lawyer, says she will run on a platform of peace with Ukraine and more political freedom at home while telling the Associated Press that \"of course, I am afraid\" given what Mr. Putin does to political opponents. Observers widely expect that vote to be rigged in Mr. Putin's favor, which itself is a sign that the Kremlin worries Russians might want other leadership if given a genuine choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't to minimize the many and great evils afflicting the world, whether traditional apocalyptic horsemen such as war and disease or their more modern cousins such as terrorism and political repression.

    "Just a few miles west of some of the country's most iconic beaches, densely built Sydney suburbs are amplifying the dangers of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction site was only 15 miles inland from Bondi Beach on Australia's east coast, but it may as well have been a world away. When the first heat wave of the summer hit earlier this month, the broiling conditions left Apenisa Marau's co-worker too delirious to function, with a pounding head and sore, aching eyes. He was moved to a cool corner to rest and hydrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The western expanse of Sydney, the country's biggest city, has always been warmer than the coastal suburbs because of geography. Cooling sea breezes don't reach these low-lying plains, which also receive less rainfall than the east.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in recent decades, the region has become even hotter because of rapid urban development. It is now peppered with so-called heat islands -- densely built and populated neighborhoods that trap heat and magnify the effects of a warming planet. Temperatures can be as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) higher than in Eastern Sydney.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat waves cause more deaths globally than all other natural disasters combined. In Australia, the hot and dry El Niño weather pattern has returned after more than half a decade and made the summer an acute danger to the millions of people who live in Western Sydney.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Marau, 28, moved to Australia from Fiji in early 2022 to escape the cyclones, floods and rising seas on his home island of Vatulele.\n",
    "\n",
    "''When I came over to Australia, I thought we wouldn't face any of these things. But I didn't know about these heat waves,'' he said. ''It's quite scary, it's inescapable.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Western Sydney has one of the fastest-growing urban populations in the nation, mostly fueled by international migration. Cheaper housing is a big draw: Median property prices can be almost three times less than in the city center. As the area's population has grown to about 2.5 million -- nearly one in every 10 Australians now lives in Western Sydney -- so has urban development. The number of green spaces is decreasing, while the number of artificial surfaces, like bitumen and concrete, which absorb and radiate heat, is increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some researchers warn that if the Earth keeps warming at a rapid rate, the number of extreme heat days, those with temperatures higher than 95 degrees Fahrenheit, will increase fivefold to 46 by 2090.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Marau lives in the suburb of Cabramatta and shares a three-bedroom house with eight people to save money on energy bills. Others residents of Western Sydney hang quilts in windows to block sunlight, or spend entire days inside air-conditioned shopping malls, said Aquilina Pinto, a community services worker who has lived in the suburb of Mount Druitt for four decades, and whose family has been affected by extreme temperatures. Her uncle died from heatstroke while washing his car.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summer has her fearing the worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We'll have more deaths, definitely,'' she says. ''We are suffering.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite calls for governments and developers to adopt more climate-conscious building practices, heat islands are expanding rather than shrinking, said Sebastian Pfautsch, an associate professor in urban planning at Western Sydney University.\n",
    "\n",
    "''What we're doing is putting hundreds of thousands of people into the area where we can expect extreme heat stress to increase,'' he said. ''It's a very daunting situation.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokesperson for the New South Wales planning and environment department, a state-level authority, said it was aiming to increase the tree cover across Sydney by 2036, with priority given to the hottest parts of the west.

    "At the University of Sydney, Ollie Jay, who calls heat a ''silent killer,'' has spent years trying to understand how to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures. Using a sealed ''climate chamber'' inside his research lab, he and a team of researchers simulate heat waves to study the physiological effects of heat on the human body -- and the point at which they become harmful, or even fatal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat-related mortality in Australia, some experts believe, has been dramatically underreported. Fatalities are typically accompanied by one of three complications -- heatstroke, heart attack or kidney failure, ailments that get recorded as the cause on death certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another recent study, in which Dr. Jay was involved, found that humans' ability to survive extreme temperatures has probably been vastly overestimated. This is especially worrisome for those in Western Sydney's heat islands, whose predominantly lower socioeconomic status puts them at greater risk.\n",

    "''We are the worst-resourced area in Sydney,'' said Lai Heng Foong, an emergency physician at a Bankstown hospital and the chair of New South Wales' Medical Staff Council. ''I don't think we're prepared,'' she said, adding that local hospitals are already stretched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the problem, Dr. Lai Heng said, is getting governments and communities to take the dangers of heat seriously. Compared with raging bushfires and surging floods, she said, heat is undramatic, invisible and ''insidious,'' an ''out-of-sight-out-of-mind-type of disaster.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''The whole thing that stresses me is this is completely preventable,'' she said. ''We know it's going to happen, and people just think that we can get away with it. But we can't.''\n",

    "Running the Democratic Republic of Congo is a tough and dangerous job. For decades, this African country the size of Western Europe has lurched between dictatorships, wars and vast humanitarian crises. Despite extraordinary natural resources, it remains desperately poor. Two leaders have been killed.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, 19 candidates are in the race to become Congo's next president in elections, the fourth in Congo's history, that took place on Wednesday -- and another 100,000 are running for seats in national, regional and local assemblies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vote is being closely watched not only by Congo's nine neighbors, with whom it shares 6,500 miles of borders, but also by foreign powers. International interest in Congo has soared in recent years as countries try to stem climate change and transition to clean energy: Congo has the world's second largest rainforest, as well as deep stores of the rare minerals needed to make electric cars and solar panels\n",
    "\n",
    "After polling stations opened -- or failed to open -- creating long lines and scenes of disorder, the election took a rocky turn. In the capital, Kinshasa, where polling stations opened hours late, heated confrontations ensued between voters and officials. In several provincial towns, frustrated voters ransacked polling sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "By midmorning, the largest poll monitoring body, run by the Roman Catholic Church, had reported violence at 8 percent of polling stations. By Wednesday evening, the national election commission announced that voting would continue on Thursday in areas where polling stations had failed to open at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous presidential candidate is Denis Mukwege, a gynecologist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for his work with sexual assault victims. But the firm favorite is the incumbent, President Felix Tshisekedi.\n",
    "\n",
    "A voter poll published Tuesday by Ebuteli, a Congolese political research organization, and the Congo Research Group, based at New York University, gave Mr. Tshisekedi 49 percent support. His nearest rival, Moïse Katumbi, a business tycoon and one-time governor of the mineral-rich Katanga province, got 28 percent. Mr. Mukwege got less than 1 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Populism and mud slinging dominated the monthlong campaign. Candidates stoked ethnic tensions with inflammatory language, or even threatened to declare war on neighboring countries. At least one person died in clashes between rival groups, Human Rights Watch said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet many Congolese have been eager to vote. A frantic cacophony filled the broken streets of Kinshasa this week as rival campaigns made a last-minute push for votes. Music blared. Lines of motorbikes splashed through puddles. Bombast flowed, as did money.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We are the victory before the victory,'' declared Rovernick Kola, 29, a motorbike rider waiting to be paid $20 for driving in a convoy that waved posters of a parliamentary candidate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Organizing an election in such a vast country would tax any bureaucracy -- never mind in the world's fifth-poorest country, with a population of about 100 million people, and some of Africa's worst infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach all of Congo's 75,000 polling stations, the authorities sent Korean-made voting machines by boat on the Congo River, by plane across over 1,000 miles, and by foot into some of the world's most impenetrable forests -- a journey that can take three weeks, election observers say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ballots for 44 million registered voters were flown in from China, although the enduring conflict in eastern Congo meant at least 1.5 million people were not able to vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire effort cost $1.2 billion, the national election commission said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voting cards have been a major problem. In Congo's hot, humid climate, the ink on many cards issued earlier this year has rubbed off in recent weeks. One survey of Kinshasa residents this week found that 73 percent of their cards were illegible -- a recipe for chaos that played out at the polls on Wednesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electoral observers worry that turmoil could facilitate cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The government created a system that allows numbers to be manipulated,'' said the Rev. Rigobert Minani, the head of the biggest Catholic election group. ''There's a big potential for fraud.''\n",

    "\n",
    "'Fatshi,' the front-runner\n",
    "\n",
    "When he came to power in 2019, promising to tackle corruption and empower the press, Mr. Tshisekedi offered at least the prospect of change in Congo. But his election was highly contentious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although results tallied by the Catholic Church showed that another candidate had won the December 2018 vote, Mr. Tshisekedi struck a power-sharing deal with the outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, that made him president.\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States blessed that arrangement, which some saw as the best way to end Mr. Kabila's 18 years of erratic, often harsh rule. But within a year it collapsed, and Mr. Tshisekedi, known to supporters by the diminutive ''Fatshi,'' set about consolidating his power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, critics say that his rule has grown increasingly repressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Kinshasa main prison last Saturday, Stanis Bujakera, one of Congo's best-known journalists, sat in the sweltering courtyard. Nearly 100 days earlier, the police had arrested him on charges of ''spreading false information.'' Now they were pressing him for his sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Bujakera, who is 33 and a U.S. resident, refused to talk. ''It's not just me,'' he said: Four other reporters have been threatened or assaulted by government officials or Tshisekedi supporters in the past month, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the campaign trail, Mr. Tshisekedi whipped up anger against Rwanda, which he blames for the conflict in the east, and at a rally on Monday even threatened to declare war against Rwanda.\n",
    "\n",
    "He sought to denigrate Mr. Katumbi, whose father was a Greek Jew, as an agent of foreign powers, and claimed that his opponent had paid Russian hackers to rig the election results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Katumbi, for his part, slammed Mr. Tshisekedi for failing to deliver on promises to provide basic services to ordinary Congolese. And he criticized Mr. Tshisekedi for what he called his lavish lifestyle.\n",

    "The shadow of Lumumba\n",

    "A gold tooth is the last remaining trace of Patrice Lumumba, Congo's first prime minister, who was assassinated in 1961 after barely a year in office.\n",
    "\n",
    "Belgium returned the tooth to Congo last year after it was retrieved from the home of a former colonial officer who had disposed of Mr. Lumumba's body, but kept the tooth as a trophy. Now it sits in a coffin at a monument on a busy Kinshasa traffic junction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoking Mr. Lumumba is an article of faith for Congolese politicians. To many, his fate embodies a tragic history shaped by meddlesome foreign powers that coveted Congo's minerals or used the country as a geostrategic battleground.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1960s, the C.I.A. plotted to kill Mr. Lumumba, believing he was a puppet of the Soviet Union. That presumption was false, Stuart A. Reid, author of ''The Lumumba Plot,'' said in an email. But there are striking similarities between that period and now.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Now, as then, the central government is dysfunctional and cannot exert control over the country's entire territory. Now, as then, U.N. peacekeepers have been sent in to provide security, and Congolese leaders wish to kick them out,'' Mr. Reid said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''And now, as then,'' he added, ''the framework of geopolitical rivalry guides Washington's thinking'' about Congo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wild card\n",
    "\n",
    "Since leaving office in 2019, Mr. Kabila, the former president, has kept a remarkably low profile -- rarely appearing in public, and speaking out even less.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in this election, speculation has grown that he is poised for a comeback. His party has called for a boycott of the vote, and he has been in regular touch with Mr. Katumbi, the main opposition challenger, Western officials said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several visitors to Mr. Kabila at his large ranch in the far south of Congo said he does little to hide his resentment of Mr. Tshisekedi, whom he accuses of betrayal.\n",
    "\n",
    "That has given rise to concerns among Western officials and some Congolese that, should this election turn to chaos, Mr. Kabila could use his vast wealth -- widely estimated to be in the billions -- and his deep connections inside the security services to somehow exact payback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether that will amount to anything is unclear. But it adds an extra element of volatility to an already-tense election.\n",

    "Re ''Supreme Contempt for Women,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Dec. 17):\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to underscore and expand on a point in Ms. Dowd's column about the death of Savita Halappanavar in Ireland because she was denied medical completion of her miscarriage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her preventable death, which laid bare the disdain for women's lives underpinning the so-called pro-life movement, enraged the Irish public and led to a referendum making first-trimester abortion legal in Ireland, where it is now publicly funded and provided in family doctors' offices as part of primary care.\n",

    "\n",
    "But we should further learn from Ireland that the 15-week compromise being promoted by some Republican politicians would not have helped Kate Cox, the Texas woman who recently sought to terminate her pregnancy after the diagnosis of a fatal fetal defect, nor would it help the many others whose complications arise after 15 weeks. A more useful frame for abortion policy is ''as early as possible, as late as is necessary.''

    "Rondônia State officials say JBS, the world's biggest meat producer, is buying cattle raised in an illegally deforested Amazon reserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brazilian authorities are seeking millions of dollars in damages and fines from the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS, and three smaller slaughterhouses, according to court filings that accuse them of buying cattle raised on illegally deforested lands in the Amazon rainforest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lawsuits come as JBS is pursuing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which would give the company expanded access to capital. They are expected to increase pressure on the company, which was recently the subject of a Senate hearing because of its supply chain's links to deforestation. The United States is JBS's largest market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 17 suits, brought by Rondônia State, in the country's west, say that the companies have bought cattle raised in one of the Amazon's most devastated protected areas, the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve, which has lost 77 percent of its forest cover since it was created in 1996. Dozens of members of the traditional communities there have left in fear of the land-grabbers and ranchers who have taken over most of the reserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "JBS is the biggest purchaser of cattle from the Amazon rainforest, and experts say ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation there. Forest destruction, coupled with climate change, is already transforming humid ecosystems that store huge amounts of planet-warming gases into drier zones that instead release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The result is a double blow against efforts to combat climate change and biodiversity loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Times investigation in 2021 found that leather from cattle raised in Jaci-Paraná had ended up on the seats of pickup trucks, S.U.V.s and other vehicles sold by some of the world's largest automakers. JBS was a key supplier of the leather. At the time, it disputed allegations that it had bought cattle raised on illegally deforested lands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement on Wednesday, JBS said that it runs a robust monitoring system in Brazil that covers an area three times the size of Britain to guarantee its suppliers do not occupy any areas illegally. ''JBS is committed to a sustainable beef supply chain,'' the company said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three of the 17 lawsuits, which were first reported by The Associated Press and Agência Pública, are against JBS and a group of farmers who are accused of selling the company cattle raised on farms in the reserve. The other suits are against three smaller meatpackers that are accused of buying hundreds of cattle raised in the reserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rondônia State authorities say farmers sold 227 cattle raised on about 1,000 acres of illegally deforested land to JBS between 2019 and 2021. The state is seeking almost $3.5 million in damages from the company and the farmers. It is also imposing fines of more than $400,000 on JBS, though those could be challenged in court. Attorneys for the state did not reply to a request for comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "JBS has made some progress in compliance in recent years, after federal prosecutors in Pará State filed lawsuits seeking environmental damages from a group of meatpackers in 2009. Prosecutors did not win the case but went on to establish a program that audits cattle purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "An audit of JBS's cattle purchases in Pará found that 6 percent had come from so-called irregular ranches, a steep drop from 2020, when an audit found that 32 percent of animals had come from irregular sources. The same audit in Rondônia this year found that 12 percent of cattle purchases by JBS did not comply with the law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deforestation rates in the Brazilian part of the rainforest have fallen to a five-year low over the past 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "''There are signs things are improving,'' said Paulo Barreto, a researcher who focuses on cattle ranching at Imazon, a nonprofit research organization based in Belém, Brazil. But, he added, change was not coming fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments come and go, he said, so ''this stronger commitment from companies is very important to signal to politicians that things won't go back to the way they were before.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawsuits that seek to hold meatpackers responsible for deforestation are rare, Mr. Barreto said. That's partly because purchases of cattle raised in illegally deforested lands are often hard to trace; they go through middlemen who present documents falsely attesting that the animals came from legal farms, the 2021 Times investigation found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who has been investigating cattle ranching for more than a decade, said the Rondônia lawsuits ''strengthen the need for the country to improve traceability.'' Without that, he added, ''we will keep having the same problems.''\n",
    "\n",
    "A judge in Rondônia, Pedro Sillas Carvalho, signaled doubts about the lawsuits brought by the state, according to one filing from last week.

    "Upward Mobility: Why Harvard Can't Fire Claudine Gay\n",
    "\n",
    "By Jason L. Riley \n",
    "858 words\n",
    "20 December 2023\n",
    "The Wall Street Journal\n",
    "J\n",
    "A19\n",
    "English\n",
    "Copyright 2023 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why did the University of Pennsylvania hold Liz Magill to a higher standard than Harvard is holding Claudine Gay?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both presidents were guilty of indulging antisemitism on campus, repeatedly equivocating on what should have been a straightforward response to the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, and embarrassing their institutions when testifying before Congress. Yet Ms. Gay has kept her job and Ms. Magill has been shown the door. You don't need a Harvard degree to understand that Ms. Gay, the school's first black president, advances the diversity imperatives of her institution in ways that Ms. Magill, who is white, doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone suggesting that Ms. Gay deserves the same treatment as Ms. Magill stands accused of racism by liberal elites who maintain that all black people not named Clarence Thomas are off-limits to criticism. The head of the NAACP, Derrick Johnson, insisted that disapproval of Ms. Gay's leadership is \"nothing more than political theatrics advancing a white supremacist agenda.\" More than 80 black faculty members at Harvard signed a letter stating that \"any suggestion that her selection as president was the result of a process that elevated an unqualified person based on considerations of race and gender are specious and politically motivated.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Gay's defenders pretend that her qualifications for the job are indisputable and that her being hired had nothing to do with race. That's baloney and they know it. Bill Ackman, the hedge-fund manager and Harvard megadonor who has led calls for her ouster, said he was told that the search committee that chose Ms. Gay \"would not consider a candidate who did not meet the DEI office's criteria,\" using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion. There is little reason to doubt him.\n",
    "\n",
    "That universities take race into account to fill job openings might be the worst-kept secret in academia. As CNN's Fareed Zakaria put it recently, a \"white man studying the American presidency does not have a prayer of getting tenure at a major history department in America today.\" Hiring for new faculty positions, particularly in humanities departments, \"now appears to center on the race and gender of the applicant, as well as the subject matter, which needs to be about marginalized groups.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier this year, the Supreme Court scolded Harvard for using racial preferences to admit students. Why wouldn't it have been doing the same thing to hire faculty, staff and administrators? On campus, that appears to be the assumption. After Ms. Gay landed the top job last year, the school newspaper hailed the appointment of \"the first Black president and president of color in the history of the University\" and editorialized that it \"feels as though it heralds the start of a more progressive era at Harvard, one that understands representation, diversity, and inclusion as essential to creating the kind of vibrant intellectual community that can in turn create a better world.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent that Ms. Gay's academic bona fides were highlighted, it was to show that they advanced the DEI agenda. As dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the paper gushed, \"she created an expansive initiative on inequality in America, oversaw hires intended to bolster Harvard's offerings in the areas of climate change and ethnic studies, and sanctioned several well-known professors accused of sexual harassment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Gay's predecessor, Lawrence Bacow, spent 10 years as president of Tufts University and 24 years on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before taking over at Harvard. His predecessor, Drew Gilpin Faust, was already a noted historian who had taught for two decades at the University of Pennsylvania and authored several well-received books in her specialty, the Civil War South.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that Ms. Gay's defenders don't want to acknowledge that her administrative experience and scholarly credentials don't begin to match those of other people in similar posts. The same can't be said of Ms. Magill, who was dean of Stanford Law School, provost of the University of Virginia and a clerk for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before being tapped to run Penn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Gay wasn't hired for her academic chops, and her problematic publishing record has become an additional embarrassment. Harvard has been forced to acknowledge multiple instances of \"inadequate citation,\" which is more commonly known as plagiarism. By some counts, close to half of Ms. Gay's academic output contains instances of copying word-for-word from another source without using quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harvard's dilemma illustrates a broader practical problem with racial-preference policies. Once you lower standards for hiring administrators or admitting students, you are forced to lower standards for evaluating their conduct and performance. For purposes of window dressing, people who have no business running elite institutions such as Harvard have been put in charge of people who have no business teaching or matriculating there. What could go wrong?\n",

    "EV Startups Stumble at the Gate --- At least 18 companies are at risk of running out of cash after 2024\n",

    "\n",
    "Electric-vehicle startups were flying high just a few years ago. Now many are focused on survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "At least 18 EV and battery startups that went public in recent years were at risk of running out of cash by the end of 2024 as of their most recent filings, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. They include companies such as Nikola and Fisker, which attracted investors with bold promises to transform the industry and fight climate change with their electric trucks and SUVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was before they stumbled amid rising costs and manufacturing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three companies -- Lordstown Motors, Proterra and Electric Last Mile Solutions -- have filed for bankruptcy. Battery maker Romeo Power and charging firm Volta have been sold at a fraction of their valuations when they went public. Several of those remaining say they are working to reduce costs and have since raised capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median stock among the companies that the Journal evaluated is down more than 80% from its market debut and even further from its peak. The slide has wiped out tens of billions of dollars in market value in just a couple of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was by far the most insane bubble I have ever seen,\" said Gavin Baker, chief investment officer at Atreides Management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all of the struggling companies went public through special-purpose acquisition companies. SPACs are alternatives to traditional initial public offerings that surged in popularity during the pandemic. Unlike IPOs, they let startups make unchecked projections about how quickly they could grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid change in fortunes for EV startups highlights the risks of investing in the industry, which continues to shift in unexpected ways. Demand is growing steadily but hasn't exploded as many startups and investors predicted. Tesla and other market leaders are also cutting prices to win customers, pressuring newcomers that are still struggling to get production started.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all its success, even Tesla nearly went bust five years ago, before the company made it through what Chief Executive Elon Musk called \"manufacturing hell\" and started mass production.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the performance of EV and battery startups, the Journal identified 43 companies that went public between 2020 and 2022. Five have filed for bankruptcy or been acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining 38, the Journal compared each company's cash flow from operations with its cash and short-term investments, using the company's most recent filings compiled by FactSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis found 18 companies were on track to run out of cash by the end of next year if they didn't cut costs or raise new capital. Seven of those had just weeks of cash on hand. When contacted by the Journal, several companies said they raised or are planning new financing and are cutting costs as they work to boost sales. Nikola, which has raised new capital since its latest filing, declined to comment. A Fisker spokesman said the company's third-quarter costs aren't necessarily reflective of future quarters, as it accelerates deliveries and improves logistics infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sixteen had enough cash to keep running beyond 2024, though struggles to increase sales are pressuring many of their share prices. They include Rivian Automotive, which makes pickup trucks that cost roughly $80,000 and promise sports-car handling, and Lucid, which makes luxury sedans that come with a similar price tag. Four of the companies were generating cash from operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among those under pressure is Faraday Future Intelligent Electric, which promised record-setting revenue growth when it went public in 2021. The company raised nearly $1 billion to develop a futuristic electric car with features such as self-driving capabilities and facial-recognition technology. The car, which comes with a starting price tag of about $309,000, took longer than expected to produce because of supply-chain disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faraday burned through an average of about $875,000 a day in the quarter ended in September. That brought its cash and short-term investments down to about $8.6 million at the end of the third quarter. A spokesman said the company has an agreement to raise capital and is focused on increasing production and reducing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies that had a cash runway beyond next year are hitting snags, too. Li-Cycle Holdings, which hopes to recycle old batteries for materials in electric cars, recently cited rising costs for pausing construction on its first big facility in Rochester, N.Y. That complicated discussions with the federal government about a potential loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its shares trade at about 65 cents, down from a $10 listing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the companies that were in danger of running out of cash by the end of next year is Canoo, which had projected in 2020 that it would generate more than $1 billion in revenue within a few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The targets were all based on a firm market and full access to unlimited capital,\" said CEO Tony Aquila, who took over in 2021 after the previous chief executive who made the projection resigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shares are down more than 95% to about 25 cents. Aquila has changed the company's strategy to save money. He said Canoo has an agreement to raise cash and that he is confident it can raise more from investors, including his family office.\n",
    "\n",
    "The declines in stock prices have boomeranged on big investors including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and conglomerate Koch Industries that pumped hundreds of millions dollars into the sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "BlackRock declined to comment. Fidelity didn't respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Koch Industries said the company is taking a long-term view on its investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "They aren't the only ones that got burned. Many individual investors also got swept up by the big promises EV startups made when they went public.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Everyone was out there looking for the next Tesla,\" said Brian Dobson, a managing director at investment bank Chardan who analyzes clean-energy companies.\n",

    "A U.S. industrial icon is being bought at a hefty premium in an all-cash deal by a Japanese competitor. U.S. politicians are already crying foul -- although regulatory arguments against a deal look questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the 1980s are calling, and they want their economic anxieties back. Nippon Steel, which on Monday announced a $14.1 billion deal to buy U.S. Steel, the storied American steel firm, is making a bold move.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the plus side, U.S. steel demand is set to get an enduring shot in the arm from industrial policy bills like the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act. U.S. manufacturing construction investment shot higher in early 2023, and the IRA will subsidize billions of dollars of steel-intensive clean-power applications like windmills. Unfilled steel orders are running at their highest level since 2008, according to figures from data provider CEIC. And American steel prices have recovered following the resolution of the United Auto Workers strike.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the minus side, Nippon Steel is paying a significant premium -- and the deal will almost certainly become a political punching bag, although to what effect is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Globally, the deal would create the second-largest steelmaker after China's Baowu. But Nippon is a much smaller player in the U.S. market than heavyweight Cleveland-Cliffs, which was among U.S. Steel's other suitors. The prospect of combining the top two domestic sheet steel producers in the U.S. was already causing jitters among some American steel consumers -- especially since steel in the U.S. already tends to be more expensive than abroad, thanks to heavy tariff protection. Domestic manufacturers -- and antitrust regulators -- might look more favorably on a deal with Nippon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, shares of U.S. Steel closed about 10% below the offer price of $55 a share on Monday, indicating investors may have lingering doubts that the deal will secure needed approvals. They continued to decline on Tuesday. Individual U.S. congressmen on both sides of the aisle have already vowed to oppose the arrangement. America's upper Midwest Rust Belt -- and the state of U.S. manufacturing -- are once again poised to play a starring role in the coming presidential election. The Japanese acquisition of a onetime American industrial icon will look like a soft target to many.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the extended bidding war has forced Nippon to pay up: At $14.1 billion, it is paying the equivalent of around 12 times U.S. Steel's earnings over the 12 months ended in September, FactSet data shows. Many U.S. competitors are significantly cheaper: Nucor trades at around nine times trailing earnings, according to FactSet, and Steel Dynamics trades around eight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The irony is that by shelling out so much for U.S. Steel, Nippon is actually making a bet that the American manufacturing renaissance will succeed, with steel demand heading structurally higher. That still won't stop politicians from taking potshots.\n",

    "The proposals include one that would ban noncompete agreements and another that would push New York to help curb deforestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will New York swear off buying paper from the Amazon rainforest to help stave off its deforestation? Should employers be able to bar workers from going to work for competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "A harried last-minute lobbying push to answer these and other questions is accelerating in Albany, where less than two weeks remain for Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign dozens of bills by year's end. Any legislation not acted upon before then will be automatically vetoed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, state lawmakers passed nearly 900 bills, touching broadly on life in New York. And while Ms. Hochul has acted on most of those measures, roughly a hundred remain, including many of the most consequential and contentious.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such measure -- a proposal to address New York's history of racial injustice by creating a task force to study and report on the impact of slavery and racism in New York -- was signed by Ms. Hochul on Tuesday. Others are less certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where things stand on some high-profile pieces of legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noncompete clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most closely watched bills is a proposal to ban noncompete agreements, a hallmark of the powerful worlds of banking and finance that are central to New York City's economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York's legislation is part of a growing national movement to restrict such provisions, which have ballooned in recent years to restrict not only Wall Street traders but also doctors, tattoo artists and even camp counselors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prospect of a ban has drawn opposition from powerful industries, including banking and media. A group associated with the Business Council of New York State has spent more than $1 million on ads warning that the legislation would be a ''job killer'' that would ''cripple business's ability to fuel innovation and retain talent.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Hochul has embraced a potential middle ground that would protect lower-wage workers but exclude high earners, although it remains to be seen whether she can reach agreement with the bill's sponsors.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We're working on language that accounts for the difference between the average worker and highly paid executives without fully restricting anyone,'' State Senator Sean Ryan, a Democrat and sponsor of the legislation, said of negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bill was delivered to Ms. Hochul on Dec. 12, beginning a 10-day clock for her to sign or veto it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shedding light into LLCs\n",
    "\n",
    "The clock is also ticking for two transparency-related measures with the potential to change the way money is spent and disclosed in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first would require state agencies to post the details of emergency contracts within 30 days of when they are awarded, an effort meant to reduce the risk of waste and corruption. The second would require businesses to list their so-called beneficial owners, a nation-leading effort that would shine a light on the shadowy world of limited liability companies, or LLCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such shell companies help shelter billions of dollars each year, some of it foreign, much of it difficult to trace. Vast sums are tied up in high-end real estate, leaving scores of luxury apartments empty even as the city faces a prolonged housing crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the proposed legislation, ownership information would be provided to the state and made public in a searchable database.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I hope the governor sees the benefit in transparency around the ownership of shell companies, both for the benefit of law enforcement but also tenants and employees,'' said State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Manhattan Democrat who is the bill's Senate sponsor. ''Most tenants don't know who their landlord is, and many employees have had their wages stolen by anonymous employers.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The Real Estate Board of New York said in a statement that it did not oppose disclosing ownership information to the state, but believed that by making such information public, the proposed database would create ''privacy and identity theft risks for New Yorkers and risks weakening New York's economy.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Hochul has pledged repeatedly to champion transparency, although she has not yet offered a position on either proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocking state spending to save trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental advocates are pushing another nation-leading measure that would reduce New York's contribution to climate change. The far-reaching measure would require the state to restrict buying from companies that do not attest that their products have not contributed to deforestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The legislation would regulate the supply chains of individual products to ensure they have not been manufactured on land that has recently been forest. Vast amounts of the world's carbon are stored in tropical forests that also serve as the sites of export for major commodities, including palm oil, cocoa and beef.\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Union passed a similar ban that is scheduled to take effect in 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York's bill would apply to paper and wood, and also the food and beverage products sold by state contractors like Sysco, which has registered to lobby on the bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Hochul presented a scaled-back version of the legislations to proponents last week. But supporters have dismissed the compromise as ''unacceptable.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to wrongful death statute re-emerge\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Legislature passed the Grieving Families Act last year, proponents celebrated, believing a victory 30 years in the making was at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bill would rewrite the state's 1847 wrongful death statute, broadening the category of beneficiaries and allowing courts to evaluate not only a decedent's earning potential but also the emotional pain caused by their death.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Ms. Hochul vetoed the bill, saying that while she believed changes should be made, the existing language was overly broad and could have unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, lawmakers tried again. They narrowed the bill slightly, limiting damages as well as the category of people who would be eligible for benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Basically what it does is expand the family members, the way family is thought of in 2023, who can recover damages,'' explained Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat and bill sponsor, noting grandparents and domestic partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The legislation remains unpopular with the insurance industry, which warns that its passage would send premiums, particularly for medical malpractice policies, skyrocketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It remains to be seen if the changes from last year's version are sufficient to win over the governor. If not, Ms. Weinstein said she intended to try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Laws are like fine wine. Sometimes it's like a Beaujolais and you introduce it and it passes and sometimes it has to age just right,'' she said. ''This is one of those that I think has started to reach the end of its aging time.''\n",

    "Dylan Field believed that selling his software company to a bigger rival would be good for competition and consumers. Regulators saw it differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the several deals that have fallen apart recently, Adobe's $20 billion takeover of Figma, an upstart design software maker, is among the most instructive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The companies had promised it was a way to ''usher in a new era of collaborative creativity,'' but regulators in three jurisdictions saw it as an unacceptable effort by a software giant to buy a promising future rival. To Dylan Field, Figma's chief executive, that contrast underscored a fundamental divide between how businesses and regulators think of competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's frustrating and sad that we're not able to complete this,'' Mr. Field said in his first interview since companies announced its demise on Monday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal's end is another feather in antitrust enforcers' caps. Both the European Commission and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority were preparing to formally challenge the transaction. (Just hours before the companies announced that the deal was dead, the C.M.A. said Adobe had refused to offer remedies to satisfy concerns.) The Justice Department -- which met with Adobe and Figma representatives last week -- had been weighing whether to oppose it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It is important in digital markets, as well as in more traditional industries, to not only look at current overlaps but to also protect future competition,'' Margrethe Vestager, the head of the European Commission's competition policy, said after the deal's demise was announced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulators had a major concern: Would allowing Adobe to buy Figma eliminate a future competitor? To some, the deal was analogous to Facebook buying Instagram in 2012. That concern has also underpinned other enforcement efforts, including those against Microsoft's takeover of the gaming company Activision Blizzard and Meta's acquisition of the virtual reality start-up Within. (Both of those deals closed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Field argued repeatedly that the deal would have enabled his company to create more offerings, but said on Monday that ''ultimately there is some gap between how regulators understand our business and how we understand our business.''\n",
    "\n",
    "By the weekend, it became clear the deal couldn't succeed. In recent weeks, ''we both have seen how the path has been narrowing,'' Mr. Field said, and abandoning the transaction would provide more clarity and certainty to employees and customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight, Mr. Field said that the enforcement climate was different now than when the companies announced their plan in September 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulators' opposition to the Adobe deal means that Figma probably won't be able to find another buyer, Mr. Field acknowledged, and the company would remain independent. He added that Figma had continued to expand during the past 15 months, more than doubling its work force to 1,300 and acquiring Diagram, an A.I.-based start-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Adobe, it will have to pay a $1 billion breakup fee to Figma. (Adobe's investors weren't put off: The company's shares closed 2.5 percent higher on Monday.)\n",

    "Every day since the trees were planted has been a roll of the dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike commodities like corn and soybeans, which Mr. Wyckoff grows on another 90 acres he owns, there is no good way to insure Christmas trees against the harm caused by extreme weather, or the effects of an overseas war or a pandemic that freezes supply chains, he added.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Farmers are the biggest gamblers there are,'' Mr. Wyckoff, 57, said. His family has been growing Christmas trees in Belvidere, N.J., about a 90-minute drive from Midtown Manhattan, since his grandfather started the business in the 1950s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christmas trees grow slowly, about 12 to 14 inches a year, and can take 10 years to go from seed to harvest. Most trees he plants are 3 to 5 years old by the time he buys them from nurseries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep up with costs, Mr. Wyckoff raised the price of his trees this year to $15 a foot, or $105 for a seven-foot tree, up from $14 a foot last year. A decade ago, similar trees sold for $10 a foot, he said. The trees he sells include the popular Fraser fir, the Norway Spruce and the Canaan and Douglas firs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the risks, the trees remain Mr. Wyckoff's most profitable crop. He expects to sell 7,000 this year, up from 5,000 last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We're currently in a boom period,'' said Tim O'Connor, the executive director of the National Christmas Tree Association. Supply was tight before the pandemic, and then demand soared for trees customers could pick and cut themselves outdoors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nationally, there were 15,000 Christmas tree farms with sales of over $376 million in 2017, according to the latest available federal data. Bert Cregg, a horticulture professor at Michigan State University and industry expert, said farmers can make a 50 percent profit on each tree. Mr. Wyckoff said his profit was closer to 20 percent a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some costs have grown sharply for Wyckoff's Christmas Tree Farm. Nearly all of Mr. Wyckoff's equipment runs on diesel fuel; he paid $4.70 a gallon this year, up from $2.36 in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate change adds to the risk that he could lose huge swaths of trees. Of the 10,000 he planted this year, 5,500 were lost to drought and flooding. That cost him at least $27,500. In a typical year, he might lose 5 to 10 percent of his new trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work is relentless. The farm has three full-time employees but a rotating cast of up to 40 seasonal workers during busy periods. Three large mowers ($20,000 each) cut down weeds every season, trees are pruned twice a year and pests and disease are monitored daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Wyckoff said he saved money by hiring high school students, getting help from local hunters and recruiting family members. His wife, Leslie, does accounting, his aunt Judy loves to mow and his 23-year-old son, Johnny, also works the farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The family's trees have won awards in national competitions and have adorned the White House, Mr. Wyckoff said. The family has met Michelle Obama and former Vice President Mike Pence and his wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Mr. Wyckoff and industry experts have some concerns about the risk of another downturn if demand drops, business is good for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hector Ruiz, 75, recently drove from Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan in search of a Fraser fir. He left with a tree shy of 5 feet tall. Most of the bigger ones were sold out.\n",
    "\n",
    "''But I'm coming back for those trees right there,'' he said, pointing to firs still in the ground and reserved for next year.\n",

    "'Bond Vigilantes' Are Back. Not Everyone Is Worried.\n",
    "\n",
    "By Talmon Joseph Smith \n",
    "2,072 words\n",
    "20 December 2023\n",

    "\n",
    "The financial world has been debating if market appetite for U.S. debt is near a limit. Not everyone agrees this is something to panic about, but the ramifications for funding government priorities are immense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the esoteric inner workings of finance and the very public stakes of government spending are viewed as separate spheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "And bond trading is ordinarily a tidy arena driven by mechanical bets about where the economy and interest rates will be months or years from now.\n",
    "\n",
    "But those separations and that sense of order changed this year as a gargantuan, chaotic battle was waged by traders in the nearly $27 trillion Treasury bond market -- the place where the U.S. government goes to borrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the summer and fall, many investors worried that federal deficits were rising so rapidly that the government would flood the market with Treasury debt that would be met with meager demand. They believed that deficits were a key source of inflation that would erode future returns on any U.S. bonds they bought.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they insisted that if they were to keep buying Treasury bonds, they would need to be compensated with an expensive premium, in the form of a much higher interest rate paid to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In market parlance, they were acting as bond vigilantes. That vigilante mind-set fueled a ''buyers' strike'' in which many traders sold off Treasuries or held back from buying more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic math of bonds is that, generally, when there are fewer buyers of bonds, the rate, or yield, on that debt rises and the value of the bonds falls. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note -- the benchmark interest rate the government pays -- went from just above 3 percent in March to 5 percent in October. (In a market this large, that amounted to trillions of dollars in losses for the large crop of investors who bet on lower bond yields earlier this year.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, momentum has shifted to a remarkable degree. Several analysts say some of the frenzy reflected mistimed and mispriced bets regarding recession and future Federal Reserve policy more than fiscal policy concerns. And as inflation retreats and the Fed eventually ratchets down interest rates, they expect bond yields to continue to ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even if the sell-off frenzy has abated, the issues that ignited it have not gone away. And that has intensified debates over what the government can afford to do down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under current law, growing budget deficits increase the amount of debt the federal government must issue, and higher interest rates mean payments to bondholders will make up more of the federal budget. Interest paid to Treasury bondholders is now the government's third-largest expenditure, after Medicare and Social Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Powerful voices in finance and politics in New York, in Washington and throughout the world are warning that the interest payments will crowd out other federal spending -- in the realm of national security, government agencies, foreign aid, increased support for child care, climate change adaptation and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Do I think it really complicates fiscal policy in the coming five years, 10 years? Absolutely,'' said the chief investment officer for Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Sonal Desai, a portfolio manager who has bet that government bond yields will rise because of growing debt payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The math doesn't add up on either side,'' she added, ''and the reality is neither the right or the left is willing to take sensible steps to try and bring that fiscal deficit down.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitch, one of the three major agencies that evaluate bond quality, downgraded the credit rating on U.S. debt in August, citing an ''erosion of governance'' that has ''manifested in repeated debt limit standoffs and last-minute resolutions.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet others are more sanguine. They do not think the U.S. government is at risk of default, because its debt payments are made in dollars that the government can create on demand. And they are generally less certain that fiscal deficits played the leading role in feeding inflation compared with the shocks from the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joseph Quinlan, head of market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, said in an interview that the U.S. federal debt ''remains manageable'' and that ''fears are overdone at this juncture.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Samuel Rines, an economist and the managing director at Corbu, a market research firm, was more blunt -- laconically dismissing worries that a bond vigilante response to debt levels could become such a financial strain on consumers and companies that it sinks markets and, in turn, the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "''If you want to make money, yawn,'' he said. ''If you want to lose money, panic.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The debate over public debt is as fierce as ever. And it echoes, in some ways, an earlier time -- when the term ''bond vigilantes'' first emerged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1983, a rising Yale-trained economist named Ed Yardeni published a letter titled ''Bond Investors Are the Economy's Bond Vigilantes,'' coining the phrase. He declared, to great applause on Wall Street, that ''if the fiscal and monetary authorities won't regulate the economy, the bond investors will'' -- by viciously selling off U.S. bonds, sending the government a message to stop spending at its heightened levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the fiscal side, Washington reined in spending on major social programs. (A bipartisan deal had actually been reached shortly before Mr. Yardeni's letter.) On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve began a new series of interest rate increases to keep inflation at bay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Treasury bond sell-off continued into 1984, but by the mid-1980s, bond yields had come down substantially. Inflation, while mild compared with the 1970s, averaged about 4 percent in the following years, a level not tolerable by contemporary standards. Yet interest payments on government debt peaked in 1991 as a share of the U.S. economy and then declined for several years.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sequence of events may be an imperfect guide to the Treasury bond market of the 2020s.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time around, the Peterson Foundation, a group that pushes for tighter fiscal policy, has joined with policy analysts, former public officials and current congressional leaders to push for a bipartisan fiscal commission aimed at imposing lower federal deficits. Many assert that ''tough questions'' and ''hard choices'' are ahead -- including a need to slash the future benefits of some federal programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But some economic experts say that even with a debt pile larger than in the past, federal borrowing rates are relatively tame, comparable with past periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a recent report by J.P. Morgan Asset Management, benchmark bond yields will fall toward 3.4 percent in the coming years, while inflation will average 2.3 percent. Other analyses from major banks and research shops have offered similar forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that scenario, the ''real'' cost of federal borrowing, in inflation-adjusted terms -- a measure many experts prefer -- would probably be close to 1 percent, historically not a cause for concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Tooze, a professor and economic historian at Columbia University, argues that current interest rates are ''not a cause for action of any type at all.''\n",
    "\n",
    "At 2 percent when adjusted for inflation, those rates are ''quite a normal level,'' he said on a recent podcast. ''It is the level that was prevailing before 2008.''\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990s, when bond vigilantes helped prod Congress into running a balanced budget, real borrowing rates for the government were hovering higher than they are now, mostly around 3 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the broader context of the interest rate controversy, there is disagreement on whether to even characterize U.S. debt as primarily a burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stephanie Kelton, an economics professor at Stony Brook University, is a leading voice of modern monetary theory, which holds that inflation and the availability of resources (whether materials or labor) are the key limits to government spending, rather than traditional budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. dollars issued through debt payments ''exist in the form of interest-bearing dollars called Treasury securities,'' said Dr. Kelton, a former chief economist for the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. She argues, ''If you're lucky enough to own some of them, congratulations, they're part of your financial savings and wealth.''\n",
    "\n",
    "That framework has found some sympathetic ears on Wall Street, especially among those who think paying more interest on bonds to savers does not necessarily impede other government spending. While the total foreign holdings of Treasuries are roughly $7 trillion, most federal debt is held by U.S.-based institutions and investors or the government itself, meaning that the fruits of higher interest payments are often going directly into the portfolios of Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "David Kotok, the chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors since 1973, argued in an interview that with some structural changes to the economy -- such as immigration reform to increase growth and the ranks of young people paying into the tax base -- a debt load as high as $60 trillion or more in coming decades would ''not only not be troubling but would encourage you to use more of the debt because you would say, 'Gee, we have the room right now to finance mitigation of climate change rather than incur the expenses of disaster.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University and a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research, said he thinks ''there is a lot of misinformation'' about current U.S. debt burdens but made clear he views them ''as a big deal and a bad situation.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''The way I look at it, there are four ways out of this,'' Mr. Harvey said in an interview. The first two -- to substantially raise taxes or slash core social programs -- are not ''politically feasible,'' he said. The third way is to inflate the U.S. currency until the debt obligations are worth less, which he called regressive because of its disproportionate impact on the poor. The most attractive way, he contends, is for the economy to grow near or above the 4 percent annual rate that the nation achieved for many years after World War II.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others think that even without such rapid growth, the Federal Reserve's ability to coordinate demand for debt, and its attempts to orchestrate market stability, will play the more central role.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The system will not allow a situation where the United States cannot fund itself,'' said Brent Johnson, a former banker at Credit Suisse who is now the chief executive of Santiago Capital, an investment firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "That confidence, to an extent, stems from the reality that the Fed and the U.S. Treasury remain linchpins of global financial power and have the mind-bending ability, between them, to both issue government debt and buy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are less extravagant tools, too. The Treasury can telegraph and rearrange the amount of debt that will be issued at Treasury bond auctions and determine the time scale of bond contracts based on investor appetite. The Fed can unilaterally change short-term borrowing rates, which in turn often influence long-term bond rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I think the fiscal sustainability discourse is generally quite dull and blind to how much the Fed shapes the outcome,'' said Skanda Amarnath, a former analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the executive director at Employ America, a group that tracks labor markets and Fed policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, according to the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a leading group of Wall Street traders, auctions of U.S. debt ''continue to be consistently oversubscribed'' -- a sign of steady structural demand for the dollar, which remains the world's dominant currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Parker, the chief executive of Trivariate Research and a former director of quantitative research at Morgan Stanley, says that concerns regarding an oversupply of Treasuries in the market are conceptually understandable but that they have proved unfounded in one cycle after another. Some think this time is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Maybe I'm just dismissive of it because I've heard the argument seven times in a row,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest paid to Treasury bondholders is the government's third-largest expenditure, after Medicare and Social Security. Many do not think the U.S. can default, because its debt payments are made in dollars that it can create on demand.

    "Economists offer alternatives to financial safeguards created when the U.S. was the pre-eminent superpower and climate change wasn't on the agenda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Martin Guzman was a college freshman at La Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina, in 2001 when a debt crisis prompted default, riots and a devastating depression. A dazed middle class suffered ruin, as the International Monetary Fund insisted that the government make misery-inducing budget cuts in exchange for a bailout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watching Argentina unravel inspired Mr. Guzman to switch majors and study economics. Nearly two decades later, when the government was again bankrupt, it was Mr. Guzman as finance minister who negotiated with I.M.F. officials to restructure a $44 billion debt, the result of an earlier ill-conceived bailout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today he is one of a number of prominent economists and world leaders who argue that the ambitious framework created at the end of World War II to safeguard economic growth and stability, with the I.M.F. and World Bank as its pillars, is failing in its mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current system ''contributes to a more inequitable and unstable global economy,'' said Mr. Guzman, who resigned last year after a rift within the government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repayment that Mr. Guzman negotiated was the 22nd arrangement between Argentina and the I.M.F. Even so, the country's economic tailspin has only increased with an annual inflation rate of more than 140 percent, growing lines at soup kitchens and a new, self-proclaimed ''anarcho-capitalist'' president, Javier Milei, who this week devalued the currency by 50 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The I.M.F. and World Bank have aroused complaints from the left and right ever since they were created.

    "This 21st-century clash of ideas about how to fix a system created for a 20th-century world is one of the most consequential facing the global economy.\n",

    "The I.M.F. was set up in 1944 at a conference in Bretton Woods, N.H., to help rescue countries in financial distress, while the World Bank's focus was reducing poverty and investing in social development. The United States was the pre-eminent economic superpower, and scores of developing nations in Africa and Asia had not yet gained independence. The foundational ideology -- later known as the ''Washington Consensus'' -- held that prosperity depended on unhindered trade, deregulation and the primacy of private investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Nearly 80 years later, the global financial architecture is outdated, dysfunctional and unjust,'' António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, said this summer at a summit in Paris. ''Even the most fundamental goals on hunger and poverty have gone into reverse after decades of progress.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The world today is geopolitically fragmented. More than three-quarters of the current I.M.F. and World Bank countries were not at Bretton Woods. China's economy, in ruins at the end of World War II, is now the world's second largest, an engine of global growth and a crucial hub in the world's industrial machine and supply chain. India, then still a British colony, is one of the top five economies in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The once vaunted ''Washington Consensus'' has fallen into disrepute, with a greater recognition of how inequality and bias against women hamper growth, as well as the need for collective action on the climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mismatch between institution and mission has sharpened in recent years. Pounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, spiking food and energy prices related to the war in Ukraine, and higher interest rates, low- and middle-income countries are swimming in debt and facing slow growth. The size of the global economy as well as the scope of the problems has grown immensely, but funding of the I.M.F. and World Bank has not kept pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolving debt crises is also vastly more complicated now that China and legions of private creditors are involved, instead of just a handful of Western banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World's Bank's own analyses outline the extent of the economic problems. ''For the poorest countries, debt has become a nearly paralyzing burden,'' a report released Wednesday concluded. Countries are forced to spend money on interest payments instead of investing in public health, education and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that debt doesn't account for the trillions of dollars that developing countries will need to mitigate the ravages of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are the tensions between the United States and China, and Russia and Europe and its allies. It is harder to resolve debt crises or finance major infrastructure without bumping up against security concerns -- like when the World Bank awarded the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei a contract that turned out to violate U.S. sanctions policy, or when China has resisted debt restructuring agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The global rules-based system was not built to resolve national security-based trade conflicts,'' Gita Gopinath, first deputy managing director of the I.M.F., said Monday in a speech to the International Economic Association in Colombia. ''We have countries strategically competing with amorphous rules and without an effective referee.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank and I.M.F. have made changes. The fund has moderated its approach to bailouts, replacing austerity with the idea of sustainable debt. The bank this year significantly increased the share of money going to climate-related projects. But critics maintain that the fixes so far are insufficient.\n",

    "Mia Mottley, the prime minister, spoke out two years ago at the climate change summit in Glasgow and then followed up with the Bridgetown Initiative, a proposal to overhaul the way rich countries help poor countries adapt to climate change and avoid crippling debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Yes, it is time for us to revisit Bretton Woods,'' she said in a speech at last year's climate summit in Egypt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Mottley argues that there has been a ''fundamental breakdown'' in a longstanding covenant between poor countries and rich ones, many of which built their wealth by exploiting former colonies. The most advanced industrialized countries also produce most of the emissions that are heating the planet and causing extreme floods, wildfires and droughts in poor countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mavis Owusu-Gyamfi, the executive vice president of the African Center for Economic Transformation, in Ghana, said that even recent agreements to deal with debt like the 2020 Common Framework were created without input from developing nations.\n",

    "''We are calling for a voice and seat at the table,'' Ms. Owusu-Gyamfi said, from her office in Accra, as she discussed a $3 billion I.M.F. bailout of Ghana.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet if the fund and bank are focused on economic issues, they are essentially political creations that reflect the power of the countries that established, finance and manage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And those countries are reluctant to cede that power. The United States, the only member with veto power, has the largest share of votes in part because of the size of its economy and financial contributions. It does not want to see its influence shrink and others' -- particularly China's -- grow.\n",

    "The impasse over reapportioning votes has hampered efforts to increase funding levels, which countries across the board agree need to be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Big Hole' in How to Deal With Debt\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, as Mr. Guzman said, ''even if there are no changes in governance, there could be changes in policies.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Emerging nations need enormous amounts of money to invest in public health, education, transport and climate resilience. But they are saddled with high borrowing costs because of the market's often exaggerated perception of the risk they pose as borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because they are usually compelled to borrow in dollars or euros, their payments soar if the Federal Reserve and other central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation as they did in the 1980s and after the Covid pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proliferation of private lenders and variety of loan agreements have made debt negotiations impossibly complex, yet no international legal arbiter exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zambia defaulted on its external debt three years ago, and there is still no agreement because the I.M.F., China and bondholders are at odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a ''big hole'' in international governance when it comes to sovereign debt, said Paola Subacchi, an economist at the Global Policy Institute at Queen Mary University in London, because the rules don't apply to private loans, whether from a hedge fund or China's central bank. Often these creditors have an interest in drawing out the process to hold out for a better deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Guzman and other economists have called for an international legal arbiter to adjudicate disputes related to sovereign debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Every country has adopted a bankruptcy law,'' said Joseph Stiglitz, a former chief economist at the World Bank, ''but internationally we don't have one.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States, though, has repeatedly opposed the idea, saying it is unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rescues, too, have proved to be problematic. Last-resort loans from the I.M.F. can end up adding to a country's budgetary woes and undermining the economic recovery because interest rates are so high now, and borrowers must also pay hefty fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those like Mr. Guzman and Ms. Mottley pushing for change argue that indebted countries need significantly more grants and low-interest loans with long repayment timelines, along with a slate of other reforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The challenges are different today,'' said Mr. Guzman. ''Policies need to be better aligned with the mission.''\n",

    "Environmental disaster and artificial intelligence run amok have emerged as the major science-fiction concerns of our time. Compared to those, gray, almond-eyed aliens in flying saucers, hellbent on destroying humanity, feel like a throwback to simpler times. But ''No One Will Save You,'' Brian Duffield's genre exercise, is deceptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaitlyn Dever plays Brynn, a demure semi-recluse who turns out to be surprisingly adept at fighting back the murderous visitors. The movie uses the suspenseful logistics of physical survival to grab viewers; Duffield has a terrific command of economical action filmmaking. But that is not the reason I've been mulling over this nearly dialogue-free movie since it premiered on Hulu in September: The story is actually about psychological survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "An outcast in her small town, Brynn is haunted by a traumatic event in her past, and when she fights for her life, her battle plays like an extreme version of a coping mechanism. I've read several theories about the ending, but the entire movie is coded, with the aliens' retro appearance being a major clue. Under its straightforward exterior, ''No One Will Save You'' is a melancholic look at what Brynn does not just to live, but to live with herself. -- ELISABETH VINCENTELLI\n",

    "''The Outwaters'' starts as a lighthearted found-footage account of four friends on a trip to the desert. But almost an hour into the film, a silhouetted figure appears in the dark distance, and that's when the writer-director Robbie Banfitch shifts into gut-punching high gear with a frenzied maelstrom of screams, grunts, creatures and guts. The result is an experimental fever dream, a sustained and visually stunning sensory assault -- I could smell fear -- that's singularly thrilling. Turn up the volume for a true razor's edge experience.\n",

    "Paul Owens's low-fi ''LandLocked'' delivers equally brutal blows but with softer gloves. It's about a young man (Mason Owens, the director's brother) who finds a VHS-era camera in his family's old home that lets him glimpse his past wherever he points the lens. (Owens used his real-life family's tapes as footage.) Even in empty rooms, demons long thought to be buried instead lurk, and in the film's most terrifying passage, one monstrously emerges. It's an assured, understated and deeply creepy slow-burn study of memory, loss and, most meaningfully, fatherhood. -- ERIK PIEPENBURG\n",

    "At first glance, Aatami Korpi (Jorma Tommila), the silent, bruising figure in the Finnish World War II exploitation film ''Sisu,'' wouldn't strike you as an activist. After all, he is a stoic prospector who, at the outset of the writer-director Jalmari Helander's film, discovers a mother lode of gold. But the action genre is often where bold political statements are made through simple symbolic figures. So when the vicious SS tank commander Bruno Helldorf (Aksel Hennie) learns of Korpi's riches, what arises is a Finnish anti-imperialist story with elements of female empowerment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helander interweaves these themes through common action tropes. There is the cadre of Finnish female prisoners of war held by the Nazis who will eventually become the kind of army familiar to the exploitation genre, ultimately, winning their bodily freedom. The retired Korpi is also an unstoppable killing machine so feared by the Russian army, it nicknamed him the Immortal. Helldorf throws everything at Korpi: tank shells, bullets and a minefield. Korpi remains unbowed. His repeated return from near-death scenarios is a wonderful gag that marries comical violence with thematic heft, turning ''Sisu'' into this year's sharpest resistance film. -- ROBERT DANIELS\n",

    "For me, this year in international cinema is defined by two images: one of red fumes filling the skies above a German forest in ''Afire,'' and the other of blindingly blue waves towering over a Tahitian beach in ''Pacifiction.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''Afire'' is a horror-inflected summer comedy about vulnerable masculinity and bemusing desire from Christian Petzold, known for his postmodern period melodramas (''Transit,'' ''Phoenix''). ''Pacifiction'' is a woozy thriller about modern-day colonialism from Albert Serra, the Catalan filmmaker with an acclaimed oeuvre of formally stringent, often historically perverse films (''Liberté,'' ''The Death of Louis XIV''). Both movies move away from their directors' usual obsessions with the past. They are animated, instead, by a trembling anxiety about the apocalyptic stakes of the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ''Afire,'' forest fires spurred by climate change spell doom for a group of four young lovers. In ''Pacifiction,'' a nuclear threat lurks in the ocean, the dark waters barely concealing the machinations of imperialist powers. If the elements rise dramatically to the heavens in both, it's less to inspire awe than caution -- a warning that the forces we have knowingly, venally wreaked upon the world and on one another may just consume us all. -- DEVIKA GIRISH\n",

    "At least we can wonder why Al Gore has understood so little about the putative cause to which he's devoted so much time.\n",
    "\n",
    "His comments on the now-concluded COP28 summit continued his theme of vilifying big oil and predicting doom to sell climate action, despite mountainous proof of its failure. By now, 40 years of climate change in the daily diet of news consumers has only saturated the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the public endorse the climate warnings they have been imbibing steadily yet don't volunteer to bear significant costs. Those who are easily worked up have become activists. Those inclined to skepticism remain skeptical. The few who inquire deeply know the case against CO2 is plausible but unprovable, and that difficult trade-offs amid uncertainty mock the simple-minded chants of various extremists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The political response is also fully saturated, quite prepared to spend trillions just not in a way that will actually influence climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the Biden administration, off the record, understands that subsidizing green energy will have little effect on emissions. When the Obama Democrats embraced this approach in 2010, in those more honest days they funded a National Academy of Sciences study of their handiwork. Its finding: Handouts are a \"poor tool for reducing greenhouse gases and achieving climate-change objectives.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The point would be crystallized for thinking people in a 2021 paper by Princeton economists modeling both a carbon tax and green subsidies out centuries, showing that subsidies would be expected to have a \"minuscule\" effect on emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the real mystery is the following: The public says it's concerned about climate change. An easily solved policy conundrum would seem to be a carbon tax. We have plenty of taxes. Enacting a new one could be a win-win if coupled with cuts in payroll or income taxes. If adopted by the U.S. alone, yes, it would merely shift emissions around. But if other governments were inspired by the example, emissions would be placed on a permanently lower path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The day isn't close but it's closer than you think. Congressional Republicans hanker for a border-based consumption tax; Democrats are pushing a carbon-based variant of such a tax. Their motives may be protectionist and bureaucratic, but tilt your head and you can see both parties gradually discovering how a carbon tax might help them reach a variety of policy and constituency pleasing goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately a culture of genuine dimness has engulfed many newsrooms on the subject of climate, which impedes progress. This was brought home to me in an unexpected way. Jeffrey Gerth, a former New York Times investigative reporter, emailed on a recent Saturday to explain why the skeptical writing of several of us on these editorial pages went unmentioned a year ago in his Columbia Journalism Review series on the media's Russia collusion botch: The review's then editor, Kyle Pope, insisted references to our work be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"One further note that may help you understand,\" Mr. Gerth added. \"Kyle left CJR recently to head up a journalistic venture involving climate reporting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Pope, in an email, denies the implication but his own climate writings are a round robin of \"denier,\" \"crisis\" and \"extreme weather.\" The venture he helped organize, Covering Climate Now, gives every evidence of being an exercise in journalistic sinecurism, its narrative already laid out, mastery of a difficult subject not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the low bar now prevailing, we might celebrate a recent Atlantic article. After trotting out approving paragraphs on electric vehicles, heat pumps and carbon pledges, it surprisingly credits readers with \"suspecting\" that none of this is \"making a dent.\" In fact, the failure has been continuous and uninterrupted for 40 years, a recognition apparently muffled to maintain political receptivity for the climate pork that has become the main output of the climate lobby.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, beyond the calamitous addiction to attention of Greta Thunberg, activists have nothing to show except overstimulating the deployment of wind and solar technology (which already existed, has cost advantages and disadvantages, and can find viable markets without subsidies) beyond what can be efficiently absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "My own history on the climate topic started, 22 years ago, not with a focus on the science or policy proposals, which seemed bound to be fruitless. Instead, the obvious focus even then was the colonization of the climate cause by special interests, notably oil giant BP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which brings us back to another point that's been obvious for 20 years. If worst-case warming materializes for any reason (CO2 or not), 100% of our effective response will be artificially to increase particulates in the atmosphere to reduce the amount of sunlight falling on earth. Ungodly sums were spent on the COP28 climate summit as on its predecessors. Yet this subject, which may actually matter, barely came up.\n",

    "Venture firms are knocking on more doors in search of capital. It can be a tough sell in today's slumping venture market, but some investors are happy to answer the call, seeing a chance to get into successful venture funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "About a quarter of limited partners expect to deploy less capital to venture capital in the next 12 months, while a third expect to commit more than in the prior 12 months, according to a November survey of nearly 400 investors by research firm Preqin. The share of those planning to invest more has grown since a year ago, according to the data provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the limited partners seeking venture-capital exposure is San Francisco-based GREE LP Fund. The fund-of-funds manager recently closed on $52.75 million to back U.S.-based venture funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of GREE LP Fund's capital comes from Tokyo-based publicly traded gaming and media company GREE Inc. Other investors include Japanese corporations and a Chinese family office.\n",
    "\n",
    "GREE LP Fund has already invested in funds from Khosla Ventures, Upfront Ventures, NFX, Hustle Fund, Behind Genius Ventures and others since it began deploying its fund in 2021. It backs both established and emerging funds. In the emerging category, GREE LP Fund is looking to gain access to startups working on crypto, climate, defense and other technology sectors, in addition to traditional software. Emerging venture firms are younger firms, sometimes defined as those with fewer than four funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wall Street Journal spoke with Youngrok Kim, partner and head of investments for GREE LP Fund, about the firm's approach. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "WSJ: What is it like to deploy capital into venture funds now for you as a new LP?\n",
    "\n",
    "KIM: [In the past] established firms weren't open to new LPs. Some of their LPs decreased their allocation or some decided not to reup. That opens the door to new LPs like us. We can start a relationship with them. Everything is cyclical. Now it's a little bit easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two years ago, emerging managers were able to raise capital in a month or two and everyone wanted to invest in those top-tier emerging funds. Now, we have time to evaluate these opportunities. In the next two to three years, they will become the top brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "WSJ: Many venture funds today say they are investing in artificial intelligence. Do you believe they are likely to succeed or is it a difficult sector for venture capitalists to make money?\n",
    "\n",
    "KIM: You see what they say in the pitch decks. Two years ago they all said 'Web3.' The same thing is happening for AI, now a lot of the managers squeeze AI into their investment strategy. That's what LPs want to hear. The investments venture funds make today will become something meaningful in the next five years. AI is happening now, maybe. Now people are talking about [artificial general intelligence] in five years.\n",
    "\n",
    "We invested in Khosla Ventures, which invested in OpenAI in 2018. In 2018, everyone, including myself, thought AI is old. AI was an innovation that hadn't had much impact back then. But [Founder and Managing Director] Vinod Khosla sent a huge amount of capital into this thing. It turned into something huge. That's venture capital. Because of that I try to invest in funds with a more contrarian idea of what's happening in the next five years.\n",
    "\n",
    "WSJ: There is a lot of dry powder still in venture, as firms slowed their deployment into startups after raising a lot of capital. Why are we still seeing some very large venture funds get raised?\n",
    "\n",
    "KIM: The market is not ideal, but it doesn't mean LPs won't invest in venture capital as an asset class. They had a little more room to explore new strategies, now they don't have that luxury. What they have to do is make a safe bet, which is the big brands. If we break it down VC firm by VC firm, it makes sense. One of the funds we know decided not to raise their growth fund this year, they are still deploying their previous growth fund. But they raised a fund for seed and Series A deals. If there's a fund that still has 50% of dry powder, no one will invest in them. But if you break it down by fund, by VC firm, they raise capital for the fund that they are ready to deploy.\n",

    "California became the second U.S. state to allow agencies to purify wastewater and turn it into tap water as a way of adapting to drought conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "California officials on Tuesday voted to allow wastewater from showers and toilets to be purified into drinking water as the state braces for years of drought-induced shortages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules, adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board, made California the second state, behind Colorado, to allow agencies to harness a water source that residents have largely been flushing away for generations. Already, officials in San Diego, Los Angeles and Santa Clara are preparing to build water purification systems that could supply drinking water to hundreds of thousands of households.\n",

    "Many areas in the parched West already use treated wastewater for outdoor irrigation or to replenish underground aquifers, where water is further cleansed as it percolates through the soil. But the idea of sending treated wastewater directly to homes has long struggled to overcome an ick factor in California. Opponents first denounced the process as ''toilet to tap'' in the 1990s when proposals surfaced in the Los Angeles suburbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the decades since, advances in water purification technology have emerged, while public opposition has softened as climate change has strained and disrupted the water supply in California, the nation's most populous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "''This is an exciting development in the state's ongoing efforts to find innovative solutions to the challenges of extreme weather driven by climate change,'' said E. Joaquin Esquivel, the chair of the water resources board. He added that ''these regulations ensure that the water produced is not only safe, but purer than many drinking water sources we now rely on.''\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 39 million people live in California, and the demand for water to sustain them -- and the nation's largest agriculture industry -- has shaped the state's history. Although violent winter storms saturated much of the state during the past year, California had been suffering from an extreme drought that scientists said included the driest three-year period on record. The push to exploit every drop in the state's aquifers, rivers and reservoirs has only escalated under the pressures of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water regulators spent more than a decade developing the rules on wastewater recycling, but they had faced a Dec. 31 deadline under a state legislative mandate. The vote, which was unanimous, followed years of review, including an evaluation by a dozen outside scientists and engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly permitted system allows recycled wastewater to be brought up to drinking standards in a matter of hours and pumped directly back into pipes that supply homes, schools and businesses with drinking water, according to state officials. The new rules do not require water agencies to adopt direct potable use, but will allow those willing to invest in the necessary infrastructure to submit plans for state approval after the regulations are finalized next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Esquivel observed on Tuesday that residents who live downstream from larger cities already rely on some water that has been treated and returned to rivers. And Felicia Marcus, a longtime water policy expert in California and Mr. Esquivel's predecessor as board chair, noted that water-scarce places, such as in Africa and on the International Space Station, already recycle their wastewater. She called the vote a ''historic milestone for climate resilience.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''Right now, we are sending rivers of highly treated wastewater to the ocean at a time when both our Colorado River supplies and Sierra supplies are likely going to be subject to more frequent and drier droughts,'' she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Marcus said that two water recycling projects in Southern California will be among the world's largest when completed. One effort in Los Angeles will be able to supply up to 30 percent of the city's water, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Today's landmark approval is a real breakthrough,'' said Sean Bothwell, executive director for California Coastkeeper Alliance. ''It's time for us to stop the practice of using water once and throwing it away.''\n",

    "Want a classic example of the administrative state gone wild? Get a look at the Labor Department's recently proposed 776-page rule that purports to clarify a two-page 1937 law regulating apprenticeship programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employers across America complain about a shortage of skilled workers. DOL's rule will make that worse by imposing onerous regulations on apprenticeships. The goal is to help labor unions and advance its policy of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1937 National Apprenticeship Act was intended to prevent discrimination in worker training and stop employers from using apprentices as cheap labor. The law authorized DOL to establish \"labor standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of apprentices\" that \"bring together employers and labor\" and \"cooperate with State agencies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Apprenticeships let workers acquire skills while earning a paycheck under the supervision of skilled workers. They are a common low-cost way for employers to train workers in trade occupations such as plumbing and construction. They can also serve as a worker pipeline for newer industries such as cyber-security and green manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "About half of apprenticeship programs are jointly run by labor and management, typically governed by collective-bargaining agreements. Yet unions accuse non-union employers of using apprenticeships \"to find cheap labor,\" as DOL puts it. Its proposed rule aims to make it harder and more expensive for employers to use non-union apprenticeships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule would require that apprenticeship programs provide at least 2,000 hours of on-the-job training, though many can train workers in less time. Employers would have to provide \"accessible\" and \"equitable\" facilities for all workers -- e.g., bathrooms that correspond to gender identity -- and \"personal protective equipment\" that fits \"according to each apprentice's size and body type.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies would also have to provide apprentices with the same \"allowances, rights, and protections\" as regular employees, including family leave and retirement benefits. White-collar interns aren't typically entitled to the same fringe benefits as full-time workers, so why is DOL requiring employers with blue-collar trainees to do so?\n",
    "\n",
    "DOL's manifest goal is to limit non-union programs that don't result in more union jobs. The rule would let the department dissolve programs accused by unions of misconduct or found to be non-compliant with minor government regulations and DEI benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "States would also have to provide \"a detailed, actionable plan\" for advancing DEI. As DOL notes, some states suggested it \"should avoid adding to or changing the regulations\" governing \"equal employment opportunity\" because existing administrative requirements were \"too long, complicated, or burdensome.\" But DOL disagreed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One result of DOL's regulations will be fewer job-training opportunities for minorities. The rule will also undercut the Administration's industrial policy and climate agenda. The Inflation Reduction Act's myriad green energy tax credits require employers to utilize apprentices from government-approved programs. Good luck finding them.\n",

    "Researchers in developing countries are trying to find treatments for conditions that affect the poorest people. But the system is stacked against their therapies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three years ago, Jesús Tilano went to a hospital in a thickly forested valley in Colombia with large open lesions on his nose, right arm and left hand. He was diagnosed with leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease that is spread in the bite of a female sand fly and which plagues poor people who work in fields or forests across developing countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was prescribed a drug that required three injections a day for 20 days, each one agonizingly painful. Mr. Tilano, 85, had to make repeated expensive bus trips to town to get them. Then his kidneys started to fail, which is a common side effect of the drug, as are heart failure and liver damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The cure was worse than what I had before,'' Mr. Tilano said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leishmaniasis is a terrible disease, with terrible treatments that have hardly changed in a century. The drug Mr. Tilano took was first given 70 years ago. All the treatments are some combination of painful, toxic, expensive, or challenging to administer, requiring an inpatient hospital stay or daily visits for a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the so-called ''neglected tropical diseases,'' many experts believe leishmaniasis is in a class of its own in terms of the lack of progress, in the 120 years since it was first identified, to help the two million people who contract it each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, finally, that is starting to change: When Mr. Tilano's grandson Andrés Tilano, 14, contracted leishmaniasis last year, he was treated in a clinic in Medellín, with an experimental therapy that cured his infection in days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment he received is one of several being developed by the Program for the Study and Control of Tropical Diseases, known as PECET, a small research institute based at the University of Antioquia in Medellín. In its effort to hunt for new treatments for leishmaniasis, the program has partnered with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, or DNDi, a nonprofit research and development organization based in Geneva.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the experimental treatments the researchers are evaluating are far less toxic, onerous or expensive than what exists now. But a big hurdle still stands in the way of getting them to the millions of people who need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the new treatments have been tested in a large-scale trial, or approved by Colombia's drug regulator, or adopted into the national treatment guidelines. When a drug is made by a pharmaceutical company, the firm will shepherd it through the expensive and time-consuming regulatory process.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is no money to be made on a drug for a condition that overwhelmingly affects the poor, and academic or public health institutes rarely have the resources to push a drug through to the end of the process, said Marcela Vieira, a Brazilian intellectual property lawyer with an expertise in drug development and access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global drug development system has long favored private sector firms that can bankroll experiments and diseases that afflict people with money to pay for treatments. Increasingly, new research on diseases such as leishmaniasis is coming from public sector and academic institutions in middle-income countries, particularly Brazil, South Africa, India, Cuba and China, Ms. Vieira said. The Covid-19 pandemic, during which low- and middle-income countries were shunted to the back of the line for vaccines and therapeutics, helped spur new investment into building drug development and production capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "''We need to do it, because no one will do it for us,'' said Dr. Juliana Quintero, an expert in leishmaniasis and researcher at PECET.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program's research labs sit six floors up in a bulky brick building at the University of Antioquia in Medellín. On the ground floor, Dr. Quintero sees patients who arrive on buses from rural towns. She knows that few can afford to stay in the city for a month of injections; she wants a treatment she can send home with them, ideally one they can take by mouth. Because funds for drug development for leishmaniasis are so scarce, she hopes for something that will work for every one of the 22 parasites in the family that cause variations of the disease in tropical countries around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leishmaniasis researchers have taken inspiration from Indigenous people in the region: One drug they are testing, a gel applied to lesions, is derived from a plant Indigenous people use to fight the parasite. The experimental treatment that cured Andrés Tilano is called thermotherapy, and it resembles the traditional Indigenous cure of burning the lesions. In her clinic, Dr. Quintero used a hand-held device that emitted heat at 50 degrees Celsius, or 122 degrees Fahrenheit, over top of the lesion, killing the parasite deep inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today Dr. Quintero prescribes two treatments her institute has developed and supplies them to patients under a so-called compassionate use model, since they have not yet been approved or registered by the Colombian government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Tilano and his grandson had cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is the least severe form of the disease. It can progress to mucosal leishmaniasis, when the parasite infects tissue such as that inside of the nose, or to what's called visceral leishmaniasis, when the parasite migrates to the spleen, liver or bone marrow. Untreated, the visceral form of the disease is fatal in more than 95 percent of cases; it kills an estimated 6,000 people each year, most of them in Africa and Asia. The number of deaths has dropped significantly in the past few years mainly because of progress in finding and treating leishmaniasis in India, where it is known as kala-azar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the existing treatments are so onerous and hard to get, Dr. Quintero said, few patients complete the course. That creates a newly drug-resistant parasite, which another sand fly can transmit to its family or others in their community. When Dr. Quintero went to visit Mr. Tilano at home not long ago, she met his daughter and granddaughter, who had the large circular scars of lesions that had finally healed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Tilano's son Luís, a logger who has become something of a local expert on the disease, asked Dr. Quintero to accompany him down to the bank of the Cauca River to see a neighbor who he thought might also have leishmaniasis. After navigating a field of curious cattle and a steep river bank, she crawled through the twisted vines of a fig tree and met a group of older women panning for gold at the water's edge. The neighbor, María de las Mercedes González, 55, had large lesions on her face, and Dr. Quintero used the flashlight of her cellphone to try to determine whether the parasite had already moved into the cartilage in her nose.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Imagine such a tiny animal that in one bite can cause such a problem: It's a very irritating little creature,'' Ms. González said after Dr. Quintero explained the risk she faced without treatment, and broke the news she would have to spend 10,000 pesos (about $2.50, more than she typically earns in a day of mining) to make the daily trip to the city for treatment. The drugs, at least, would be free through Colombia's public health system.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNDi, the nonprofit organization, has screened more than 2.5 million compounds -- a standard first step in drug development -- to come up with five chemical structures that seemed, in early lab tests, like they might work against the parasite that causes leishmaniasis. But of those five, only one or two will progress to larger clinical trials, said Jadel Kratz, who runs the organization's drug discovery work in Latin America.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early discovery and preclinical studies cost $10 million to $20 million, he said, while getting through the first small clinical trials for safety and some sign of efficacy could be another $6 million. The last phase, a large trial in patients to test whether the drug works, costs at a minimum $20 million -- far more than the public and academic research teams can fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's a huge risk for local research if only multinational corporations can do this work,'' said Dr. Iván Darío Vélez-Bernal, who recently retired as director of PECET, the research institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "But DNDi's focus on leishmaniasis, and the work of researchers in a network that includes India, Colombia and Brazil, is starting to pay off. Today there are five drugs in Phase 1 trials, and another in Phase 2, which is unprecedented in the history of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear when or how the drugs will get to the next phase of the process. Drugs that come out of public sector institutions tend to languish without a champion, said Ms. Vieira, who is a researcher with the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drugs that originate from public health organizations in Brazil or India are often different in key ways from ones developed by a pharmaceutical company in an industrialized country, Dr. Kratz said: The scientists creating them think about access from the start, knowing that whatever they design will have to be delivered by a low-resource health system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Colombia and neighboring Brazil, leishmaniasis mainly affects farmers, loggers and miners -- people whose work brings them into regular contact with the sand fly. But climate change is causing the fly's habitat to spread quickly, and Dr. Quintero finds herself more frequently treating cases from semi-urban areas. During Colombia's long civil war, much of which was fought in jungles, the parasite also sickened soldiers, who accounted for up to half of the cases nationally. So the army was keen to find treatment, and helped test some of the experimental drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Colombian government is missing an opportunity now by not funding the Phase 3 trial for PECET's experimental therapies, Ms. Vieira said.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The trials are expensive but it's much less than what they will pay for a treatment if it is developed by a for-profit company, or all the things that they already have to pay for, for people who are sick and don't have access to the treatment,'' she said.\n",

    "Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said there was no justification for ''violence, arson or vandalism.'' The blaze came weeks after an anti-immigrant riot in Dublin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ireland's leader has condemned a suspected arson attack after a hotel that was set to become housing for asylum seekers was burned to the ground on Saturday, the latest incident to lay bare pockets of anti-immigrant sentiment in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fire broke out before midnight at Ross Lake House Hotel in Rosscahill, County Galway, in the west of Ireland, destroying the building. Up to 70 asylum seekers were to be housed there starting this week. No injuries were reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blaze comes just weeks after violence, sparked by a knife attack in Dublin on Nov. 23, devolved into a xenophobic riot, and as the country grapples with fringe far-right violence and xenophobia that has increasingly spilled out into the light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leo Varadkar, the country's Taoiseach or Irish prime minister, said in a written statement on Sunday that he was concerned about a number of recent reports of damage, including the fire on Saturday, to places that were set to host asylum seekers around the country. It was unclear how the fire began and investigations into the circumstances continued, a police statement said, referring to the blaze as ''an incident of criminal damage by fire.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''There is no justification for violence, arson or vandalism in our Republic. Ever,'' Mr. Varadkar said. He made clear that like much of the rest of the world, Ireland was ''dealing with a major step-change in the numbers arriving here, seeking protection.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''This is driven by war, poverty, climate change and human rights abuses in their home countries,'' Mr. Varadkar said.\n",
    "\n",
    "He also added details that seemed to be directed at assuaging concerns about the vetting of asylum seekers, which has been a rallying cry of some who oppose the placement of this type of accommodation in their communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I want to assure people we have a rules-based system and are processing applications in record time,'' he said. ''All asylum-seekers are registered, fingerprinted, checked against watch lists, and the circumstances surrounding their request for asylum are examined thoroughly. We aim to treat them with dignity and respect while their applications are considered.''\n",
    "\n",
    "Ireland, like much of Europe, has received an influx of newcomers in recent years as war, climate change and economic instability have driven global migration, sometimes leaving countries struggling to adapt. In the year ending this past April, net migration to Ireland, which had a population of 5.2 million, was 77,600, second only to a net immigration record for the country set in 2007 of 104,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though asylum seekers make up a relatively small portion of the overall number of arrivals, with fewer than 14,000 people applying for asylum in Ireland in 2022, they have often been the focus of vitriol and anti-immigration sentiment. Ireland's direct provision program provides accommodation for those awaiting a decision on their asylum claim. The top five nationalities for asylum seekers in Ireland in 2023 are people coming from Nigeria, Georgia, Algeria, Afghanistan and Somalia, according to government data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ireland has also hosted more than 100,000 Ukrainians who have fled conflict in their home country since Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022 under a different temporary protection program. While asylum seekers and others wanting international protection have been successfully housed in communities across Ireland, and the vast majority have received a warm welcome, there are pockets of discontent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experts who track the far right say that extremism has proliferated in recent years on social media, as it has in the United States and much of Europe, and language portraying migrants as a threat in Ireland has made its way into the mainstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phrases popularized by far-right influencers online, characterizing migrants as ''unvetted'' and ''military-age men,'' have also increasingly been echoed by members of the public looking for somewhere to place their discontent, the experts say.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fire on Saturday is not the first time that a facility planning to host asylum seekers has been targeted in Ireland.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, groups of people set fire to hotels planning to house asylum seekers, and in the years since xenophobic demonstrations have been staged in small towns and villages countrywide. Earlier this year, a makeshift camp for refugees was set on fire in Dublin.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The people carrying out these crimes are a very small minority,'' Mr. Varadkar emphasized in his statement, adding that most people ''empathize with those fleeing truly terrible circumstances and recognize the benefits that legal migration, in general, brings to Ireland.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''I hope that as we continue through the winter, we can continue to treat those arriving here with the basic dignity and decency we would want for our own,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "A day before the blaze, a protest was held outside the Ross Lake House, with some people blocking the entrance to the hotel. People could be seen in news footage keeping warm by lighting fires in metal drums. Among them were some local politicians.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The people are afraid of what's in front of them,'' Séamus Walsh, a local councilor at the protest, told the national broadcaster RTÉ on Friday. ''This is a beautiful area, locals from around use it as a walking amenity through the woods and that. They're afraid of what they will encounter from now on with every sort of stranger in the area who they don't know.''\n",
    "\n",
    "The hotel had not been in use for more than a year, and residents of the area were recently informed that the hotel would be used to house asylum seekers as part of a government contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Politicians and rights groups have denounced the rhetoric they say is driving up local discontent.\n",
    "\n",
    "''Politicians across the board should condemn this disgraceful act and the fear-mongering that led to it,'' Roderic O'Gorman, Ireland's integration minister, said in a statement posted on the social media platform X hours after the fire.\n",

    "The inquiry is perhaps the most substantial regulatory move to date against X, which has seen a rise in incendiary content on the platform, according to researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Union announced a formal investigation Monday into X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, accusing it of failing to counter illicit content and disinformation, a lack of transparency about advertising and ''deceptive'' design practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inquiry is perhaps the most substantial regulatory move to date against X since it scaled back its content moderation policies after Mr. Musk bought the service, once known as Twitter, last year. The company's new policies have led to a rise in incendiary content on the platform, according to researchers, causing brands to scale back advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "In going after X, the European Union is for the first time using the authority gained after last year's passage of the Digital Services Act. The law gives regulators vast new powers to force social media companies to police their platforms for hate speech, misinformation and other divisive content. Other services covered by the new law include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch, had signaled its intention to look more closely at X's business practices. In October, regulators initiated a preliminary inquiry into the spread of ''terrorist and violent content and hate speech'' on X after the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "''The evidence we currently have is enough to formally open a proceeding against X,'' Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive vice president overseeing digital policy, said in a statement.

    "X said it ''remains committed to complying with the Digital Services Act and is cooperating with the regulatory process.''\n",
    "\n",
    "''X is focused on creating a safe and inclusive environment for all users on our platform, while protecting freedom of expression, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards this goal,'' the company said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation highlights a major difference between the United States and Europe in policing the internet. While online posts are largely unregulated in the United States as a result of free speech protections, European governments, for historical and cultural reasons, have put more restrictions in place around hate speech, incitement to violence and other harmful material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Services Act was an attempt by the European Union to compel companies to establish procedures to comply more consistently with rules around such content online.\n",
    "\n",
    "The announcement Monday is the beginning of an investigation without a specified deadline. The inquiry is expected to include interviews with outside groups and requests for more evidence from X. If found guilty of violating the Digital Services Act, the company could be fined up to 6 percent of global revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Mr. Musk took control of the platform, he dissolved its trust and safety council, overhauled its content moderation practices and welcomed scores of barred users back to the platform. Dozens of studies published since then have described a near-instantaneous rise in antisemitic content and hateful posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit focused on monitoring extremism and disinformation, found that antisemitic posts in English more than doubled on X after Mr. Musk's takeover. The European Commission found that engagement with pro-Kremlin accounts grew 36 percent in the beginning of this year after Mr. Musk lifted mitigation measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rash of natural disasters took place around the world this summer, climate misinformation spread widely on X. A scorecard evaluating social media companies awarded X a single point out of a possible 21 for its work defending against climate-related falsehoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.U. officials said X might not be in compliance with rules that require online platforms to respond quickly after being made aware of illicit and hateful content, such as antisemitism and incitement of violence and terrorism. The law also requires companies to conduct risk assessments about the spread of harmful content on their platforms and mitigate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Officials raised concerns about X's content moderation policies in languages other than English particularly as elections across the continent approach in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the investigation will examine X's efforts to address the spread of false information. The company relies on a feature, called Community Notes, that lets users add context to posts that they believe are misleading, an approach that E.U. officials said might not be sufficient. Regulators will also look into the ways in which posts by X users who pay to be authenticated, signified by a blue check mark, are given more visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation will test the European Union's ability to force large internet platforms to change their behavior. Mr. Musk has been an outspoken proponent for free speech rights and, in May, pulled X out of the European Union's voluntary code of practice intended to combat disinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In October, after the E.U. initiated its preliminary inquiry, Mr. Musk challenged regulators to share evidence of illicit content on X. ''Please list the violations you allude to on X, so that the public can see them,'' he said.\n",

    "With machine learning, scientists are trying to chemically define the murky concept of terroir. The models might be useful for detecting wine fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bordeaux region of southwest France, scores of vineyard estates transform finicky grapes into bold blends of red wine. Some bottles sell for thousands of dollars each. Prestigious chateaus boast about the soil, microclimate and traditional methods that make their own wine superior, an inscrutable mix known as terroir.\n",
    "\n",
    "''It's one of those terms that the wine industry likes to keep a bit mysterious, part of the magic of wine,'' said Alex Pouget, a computational neuroscientist at the University of Geneva.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Pouget is trying to apply chemical precision to this je ne sais quoi. In a study published Tuesday in the journal Communications Chemistry, he and his colleagues described a computer model that could pinpoint which Bordeaux estate produced a wine based only on its chemical makeup. The model also predicted the year in which the wine was made, known as its vintage, with about 50 percent accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although wine connoisseurs often claim to be able to distinguish among wines from top estates, they rarely do blind taste tests, he said. ''People have made those claims for decades, but we've never actually had an objective measurement that showed that this was true,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Pouget grew up in Paris in a family that drank only Bordeaux (''You pretend Burgundy does not exist,'' he said). As a young neuroscientist in the late 1980s, he studied the brain with machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence that identifies patterns in large data sets. He believed that these methods could be useful for the wine industry, but didn't get around to testing the idea for 30 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "He teamed up with Stéphanie Marchand from the Institute of Vine and Wine Science in Bordeaux, who had created a database of 80 wines of various vintages from seven chateaus. The database held the chemical signatures of each wine gleaned from gas chromatography, an old and inexpensive method for breaking substances down into their molecular components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers trained an algorithm to seek common patterns in the chemical fingerprints of the wines. They were shocked by the results: The model grouped the wines into distinct clusters that matched with their geographical locations in the Bordeaux region. This showed that the particularities of each estate had drastically influenced the chemistry of the wines produced there, just as winemakers have claimed for centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estates gave the researchers permission to study their wines on the condition that they not be named. Dr. Pouget said that all of the wines were part of the famous 1855 Bordeaux classification, a ranking instituted by Napoleon III to promote the best wines of Bordeaux.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Pouget was surprised that the winemakers did not want to disclose their names, as the study's findings reinforced the notion that their wines were special. ''I have scientific evidence that it makes sense to charge people money for this because they are producing something unique,'' he said, laughing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent researchers said that the study was part of a wave of recent research using machine learning to decipher terroir. ''This is where the field is headed and needs to head to make sense of an abundance of data,'' said David Jeffery, an expert in wine chemistry at the University of Adelaide in Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, he has used machine learning to classify Shiraz wines from the Barossa Valley in Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach, Dr. Jeffery said, is ''not only about what makes a great wine chemically.'' The models could also help producers adjust their growing and winemaking practices to preserve their product's character in years of unexpected weather. ''This is especially important in the face of a changing climate,'' he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another application of these models, experts said, is rooting out fraud, which is fairly common among expensive wines. Producers have adjusted their bottles, labels and corks to make them harder to copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "''If there is a doubt about the origin of a wine, analyzing a wine sourced from the estate as a benchmark would probably allow to know whether the wine is fake or not,'' said Cornelis van Leeuwen, the head of the viticulture and oenology department at Bordeaux Sciences Agro.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach would probably work for any wine region, so long as the model has been trained on a large array of wines from different producers and vintages, said Dr. van Leeuwen, who was not involved in the new study. An open question, though, is whether the model would retain its accuracy after a few years, he said. Even inside a bottle, wine changes over time, which means it could diverge from the patterns captured in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Pouget, who has a large wine collection, hopes to repeat the study using some of his favorite kinds from the Châteauneuf-du-Pape region in southeastern France.\n",
    "\n",
    "But among the best wines, he said, age is probably more important than provenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "''I only drink old wine,'' he said. ''I think drinking things when they're younger than 15 years is a bit criminal.''\n",

    "After two weeks of negotiation, the United Nations climate conference in Dubai agreed last week to \"transition away\" from fossil fuels. Left unanswered is whether governments are supposed to do that by reducing supply, reducing demand or both. A lot rides on the answer, but neither would affect the climate much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the demand-side scenario, technology saves the day with cost-competitive renewables. This is the vision of the International Energy Agency, according to which the more rapid the transition from fossil fuels, the more precipitous the decline in fossil-fuel prices. In its \"Net Zero Emissions\" scenario, oil demand drops faster than supply this decade, pushing oil prices below $30 a barrel soon after 2030, which corresponds to $1-a-gallon gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet even with fossil-fuel prices near historic highs, effective renewable substitutes are nowhere near cost-competitive. They'd have to get cheaper still to compete with $30-a-barrel oil. And in developed countries, especially the U.S., it's impossible to get permits quickly enough for the staggering amount of renewable capacity that would be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the supply-side approach, governments would slash oil production or impose rationing, hoping to make fossil fuels so expensive that renewables are the only option. This is the dark vision of \"Stop Oil\" and Greta Thunberg. But as long as renewable substitutes aren't immediately available and oil and gas remain necessary, a small reduction in supply causes prices to soar. That means windfall profits for energy companies, scarcity for everyone else, and electoral danger for the governments responsible. Ms. Thunberg claims that climate change is a \"death sentence\" for the poor, but the poor are far more vulnerable to disruptions in energy supply. In the 1970s, an oil boycott aimed at the U.S. caused famines in Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the stop-oil view was popular at Dubai, there were enough adults in the room to keep the conference from committing to it. \"There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phaseout of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve 1.5 C\" (the Paris Agreement's proposed limit on 21st-century temperature increases), said conference president Ahmed al Jaber, \"unless you want to take the world back into caves.\" Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman dared countries to try to choke off the oil supply: \"Let them do that themselves. And we will see how much they can deliver.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor countries are clear-eyed about the danger of energy poverty. \"We are not going to compromise with the availability of power for growth,\" said India's minister for power, R.K. Singh. China has more coal plants under construction than are in operation in the U.S. Few rich countries have announced plans to stop drilling for oil or gas, and none of those are major producers. Even President Biden ran away from increasing the gasoline tax as soon as prices went above $3 a gallon in the summer of 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "The administration's answer to this conundrum is to defer political consequences via the regulatory state. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed to require that all coal and natural-gas plants shut down or adopt unproven zero-carbon technologies by 2038. Another EPA proposal would require 62% of all cars sold in America to be fully electric by 2032.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming they survive court challenges and future administrations, they would impose soaring prices and reduced mobility on Americans. They would have almost no impact on global temperatures unless other countries, including China and India, also commit to energy poverty. The question is how much damage these policies will do before they're abandoned.\n",
