      "by Katherine Cusumano\n",

      "Julia Rottenberg, 17, spent the fall of last year knocking on doors. On Election Day 2022, people in Culver City, Calif., her hometown, would have a big decision to make: Should the voting age for local elections change from 18 to 16? Julia wanted them to vote yes. ''I think a vote is one of the most direct ways that you can express an opinion and actually have some change happen,'' says Julia, who is part of an organization called Vote16 Culver City.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the argument for giving kids the vote? Well, as you may have noticed, there are a lot of decisions being made (or not) about things that affect kids directly, like climate change or gun violence or school resources. Yes, young people are already leading political movements around these issues. But without the vote, they can't elect politicians who represent their views and make real change. ''There's a whole lot of talk about prioritizing young people and politicians saying, 'We care about your future,''' says Jessie Cai, 16, a teen organizer with Voters of Tomorrow in Maryland. Voting would be a way to hold them to their promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some places, the change is already underway. In the past 10 years, residents in a handful of American towns (a few in Maryland, one in Vermont and two in California) have all approved lowering the voting age to 16 in local elections. Teenagers are campaigning to do the same in states from New Jersey to Oregon. A member of Congress has even been pushing to change the federal voting age. And if you think the whole idea seems too out there, think about this: It used to be that you actually had to be 21 to vote. But during the Vietnam War, lots of people argued that if 18-year-olds were being forced to fight, they should also be able to vote. So in 1971, the age was lowered. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, not everyone thinks 16-year-olds are ready for the responsibility -- including the voters in Culver City, where the measure lost by just 16 votes. ''I would be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit frustrating,'' Julia says. But the fact that the loss was so narrow has just made her and other Vote16 teenagers more motivated to try again this year: ''It proves to me how much each individual voice matters.'' â—Š\n",

''I have known the truth,'' Parker writes again and again in this moving memoir, recounting his family's devastation at the 1955 lynching of his cousin, his life as a minister resisting racism and the aftermath of the F.B.I.'s 2018 \"reawakening'' of Till's murder case.\n",

In 1980s Queens, Razia bristles at the rigid expectations of her immigrant community and finds queer love at her Manhattan high school. When an aunty's observation imperils Razia's newfound freedom, Rehman complicates conceptions of culture. In this warm New York novel, ''individuals are allowed to be surprising, even to themselves,'' our reviewer wrote.\n",

The author of ''How to Do Nothing'' returns with a meditation on the ways modern society puts pressure on time. Using a day she spent in the Bay Area as a frame to consider labor, leisure, colonialism and climate, Odell argues for a radical shift in how we conceptualize both agency and change.\n",
